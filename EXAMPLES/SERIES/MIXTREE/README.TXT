PURPOSE:
    Demonstrate TreeView control and Mixer Services.   

USES:
    Based on IniTree

COMMENTS:
    This is a 32-bit only sample.  If a mixer device is present then the
    TreeView control and text displays will reflect actual components of
    the mixer device.  If no mixer device is present then simulation data
    will be used to generate the TreeView control and text displays.

    Dispatch         - Message dispatching routines
    WinMain          - Calls initialization functions and processes 
                       the message loop
    MixTree          - Implements the windows procedure for the main 
                       application window, providing message and
