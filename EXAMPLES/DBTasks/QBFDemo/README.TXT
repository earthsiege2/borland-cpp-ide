COMMENTS:
   
   To use the example:
   
      1)  Choose an alias containing tables, 
      2)  Choose a table in that alias, 
      3)  Choose a field to search, 
      4)  Pick the type of search you want to perform,
      5)  Enter a value to search for,
      6)  Choose the Show Results button.
   
   If your query returns records, then a Results Viewer displays 
   those results; otherwise, you'll receive a message indicating that
   no records matched the search.

   The Show File Extensions options lets you choose whether or 
   not file extensions are displayed for table names.
   
   The Show System Tables option is used only for remote aliases and 
   indicates whether or not the system tables should be displayed.
