COMMENTS:
  To use the Event Alerter demo:

  1)  Start by making sure that InterBase Server is running.

  2)  Run the demo application and press the "Open Database" button.

  3)  Log onto the supplied database 'events.gdb' with a password of
      "masterkey".

  4)  Enter the name of your event i.e. "MyEvent" into the "Event Registration"
      list box, and then press the "Register Events" button.

  5) To simulate the event being generated by the server, enter the previously
     registered event name into the "Generate Events" event field, and then
     press the "Generate Event" button.

  Note that the demo will log the notification from the server that the
  registered event has been generated.
