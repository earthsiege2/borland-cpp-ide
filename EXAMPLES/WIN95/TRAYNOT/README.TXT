PURPOSE:
    Demonstrates how to add an icon to the tray on the Windows 95 taskbar.

COMMENTS:
    If you use the "Hide" button to put away the main dailog of the
    application, you can right click on any of its visible icons in
    the tray to restore it.

    If you add or modify the tooltip text for an icon that is already
    in the tray, the change will not take effect until you remove and
    put back the icon.
