TITLE:
    CALCFLD

PURPOSE:
    This program demonstrates the creation and use of calculated fields that
    are supported by Borland's Visual Database Tools.  More generally, this
    example demonstrates the handling of events using the sink/source method.
    In order to make the example as straight forward as possible there is
    practically no UI coded and no data-aware controls are used.  See also
    comments in the source.
