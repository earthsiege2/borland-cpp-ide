TITLE:
   EVHANDLE -  Source-Sink Application

PURPOSE:
   This program demonstrates how to trap VDBT events using the
   source-sink method.  It uses the TDBEdit, TDBNavigator and
   TDBRadioGroup classes to show how to set up sinks and handler
   methods to trap some of the events for these controls.  It uses a
   window with a listbox client to display message strings from the
   event handler methods in order to show the event was trapped.
