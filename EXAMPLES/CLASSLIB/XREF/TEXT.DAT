The container class library provides several different
class templates to use when developing programs. If your program needs
a stack, a list, or a queue you should consider using the
corresponding template from the class library.
Several of these data structures provide multiple implementations, so
that you can select the appropriate implementation based on the runtime
characteristics of your application. For example, you can choose between
a stack implemented as a linked list and a stack implemented as a
vector. The former is usually better when the number of items on the
stack changes drastically during execution of the program. The latter
makes better use of memory when the stack is small.
