WebSnap Demos
MasterDetail directory

This example demonstrates how to use TDataSetAdapter components to view and 
edit master detail relationships.  A record from the BDE orders table along 
with associated detail items are displayed on a single HTML form.  Edit, Browse, 
and Cancel buttons are used to change the DataSetAdapter mode.  The Apply 
button submits changes to the master and details in a single HTTP request.

To run the Web App Debugger executable versino of the demo, compile the project 
ending in Debugger. Run it once to register it, start the Web App Debugger, and 
browse to:
