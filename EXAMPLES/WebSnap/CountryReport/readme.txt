WebSnap Demos
CountryReport directory

This example uses a TDataSetAdapter and custom JavaScript to 
display a simple report using the country table.

Please observe the HTML in ReportPg.html for an example of custom HTML
scripting without the need of an AdapterPageProducer.

To run the WebAppDebugger version of the demo (ending in Debugger as the project
name), compile the project and run it once to register it. Then, start the
WebAppDebugger and browse to:
http://localhost:1024/CountryReportDebugger.CountryReport
