LocateFileService directory

This example demonstrates how to implement the TLocateFileService.OnFindStream 
event to retrieve HTML templates and server side include files from a resource file.  
Embedding HTML files in a resource simplifies application deployment.

To run the Web App Debugger version of the project (with the project name
ending in Debugger), compile the project and run it once to register it.
Then, start the Web App Debugger and browse to:
  http://localhost:1024/LocateFileServiceDebugger.LocateService
