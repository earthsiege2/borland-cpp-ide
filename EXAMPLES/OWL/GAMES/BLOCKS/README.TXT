Title: BLOCKS Example

Keywords: Game;Tetris


Turbo Blocks is a faithful reproduction of the popular game Tetris.  The
game is played on a 10x20 grid.  Blocks of various shapes fall from the
top of the grid.  They stop when they hit the bottom of the grid, or
another block.  Blocks can be moved left/right (using the arrow keys),
or rotated (with the spacebar).  If an entire row of the game grid is
filled, it will disappear, and the remaining blocks will drop down to
fill in the space.  The object is to continue the game without letting
the blocks reach the top of the grid.


The following features were not implemented, and are left as an exercise
to the user:

  score

  level count

  line count

  display of the next block that will appear
