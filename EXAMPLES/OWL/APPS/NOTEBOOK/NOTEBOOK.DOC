		NOTEBOOK CLASS SAMPLE CODE - 10/12/93
		-------------------------------------

SOURCE FILES:
-------------
The following source files comprise the notebook class sample code:

	- notebook.cpp, notebook.h	(defines TNotebook class)
	- vscroll.cpp, vscroll.h	(defines vscroll gadget class)
	- hscroll.cpp, hscroll.h	(defines hscroll gadget class)
	- utils.cpp, utils.h		(code for logging debug messages)

   	- nb.cpp, nb.h			(test program for TNotebook class)
   	- pn.cpp, pn.h			(program notebook sample app)


TNotebook class:
----------------
The "TNotebook" class is a sample class designed to be "mixed-in" with
a window class.  It allows you to turn any of your windows (or subclasses
of windows) into a notebook window.  The notebook look is obtained by
taking over a part of the window non-client area (selectable from top,
right, bottom, left) and drawing notebook tabs and a mini tab scrollbar
in the area.  If the window horizontal or vertical scrollbar also belongs 
in the area, a custom (smaller) scrollbar is drawn in the area also.

The "nb" program (see below) shows the basics of how to create a notebook
and how to operate it.  There is a special method of handling the 
WM_SIZE messages for the TNotebook subclasses that will prevent multiple 
nonclient area painting.  See the comment at the top of the "notebook.cpp"
file and the "EvSize()" method in nb.cpp for more details.


NB.EXE:
-------
The "nb" program was designed to test the TNotebook class and can also
be used to test new TNotebook subclasses.  It creates notebooks with
2000 pages and draws a special pattern on each page along with the
page name.  The pattern is designed to help test whether the TNotebook
scrollbars are operating correctly (a red rectangle should be at the
leftmost, topmost, rightmost, and bottommost positions of the page).
The menu allows you to create notebooks with tabs in all 4 positions
(top, right, bottom, and left).


PN.EXE:
-------
The program "pn" is a simplified implementation of the Windows "program
manager" program with a notebook twist.  It is an MDI app where each MDI 
child window is a notebook.  On startup, the program reads the 
program manager ".grp" files and each notebook created shows the available 
groups on its tabs and allows selection of a group of icons into the 
notebook's current page.

The program "pn.exe" can be run as a normal program under program manager
or it can be used in place of program manager (by changing the "shell" line
of your windows "system.ini" file to something like "shell=c:\nb\pn.exe").
