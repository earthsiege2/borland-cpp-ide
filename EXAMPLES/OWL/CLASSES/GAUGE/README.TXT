Title: GAUGE Example

Keywords: TGauge;Progress Bar

The GAUGE example illustrates how to use the different types of gauges
available with OWL. A gauge is similar to a scroll bar. It has a range
and a current position.


There are three styles of gauges used in this example. The top gauge is
a progress bar. It is typically used to display percentage of
completion.


The second gauge, with the LED style, displays the current position in
blocks. This gauge style can be a native control or it can be emulated.
Your source code will not need to know the difference.


The third control in this example is a slider control. You can use the
slider to manipulate the current position of the two gauges to see how
they are visually different.
