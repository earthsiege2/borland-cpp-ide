This project is an example of multi-targeting in the new project manager.

The two multitrg.exe targets in the project are mostly similar with two major
differences: The local options for the first target specifies output 
directories to point to .\out16 and is tagged as Win3.x (16 bit) 
applictation in TargetExpert. The second target has local options specifying
output directories to point to .\out32 and is tagged as a Win32 appliction
in TargetExpert.

The targets were created by
1) selecting Project|New Target,
2) typing "multitrg" in the 'Target Name' field,
3) selecting 'Standard' from the 'Target Type' list,
4) selecting 'Ok'

This leads to TargetExpert where:
5) selecting "Windows 3.x (16 bit)" from the 'Platforms' list
6) selecting 'Ok'

Repeating steps 1-6 for the second target with the exception of step (5)
where "Win32" was selected from the 'Platforms' list.

To redirect output on the first target to the 'out16' directory
6) Right click on the first target
7) Select 'Local Options' with brings up the Multi-Page-Dialog
8) In the 'Directories' section entering 'out16' in the 'Intermediate'
and 'Final output' fields.
9) Select 'Ok'

Repeating steps 6-9 for the second target replacing 'out16' with 'out32'
completes the process.

You should note that the source nodes under both executables are copied
under each target. If you wanted to add a source module you would have to
do so (in this project) in two places to keep you 16bit and 32bit targets
in synch. To get relief see the example in the SrcPool directory.
