
This project demonstrates the use of a simple source pool target and 
'reference copying' within the the project. 

Source pools are abstract container objects that hold dependencies. 
There are not buildable and runnable by themselves. However, when moved, 
copied or (most useful:) reference copied to under 'real' targets, they 
take on the options and target attributes of the context they are in. 
When the project make facility is checking dependencies or building 
response table for linkers and librarians, the SourcePool becomes 
invisible and the node is seen from the target as a direct dependency.

Reference copying allows one node (and all of it's dependencies) to be 
referenced in many different places in the project's dependency tree. 
In this example we reference copy a SourcePool node to under two
executables (a 16bit target and a 32bit target, both called whello.exe).
This allows you to modify the contents of the SourcePool, adding or 
deleting nodes or changing the names of node or their 
node-types, and having the change automatically update all of the 
references to the SourcePool.

NOTE: The example here assumes that you've looked at the example in the 
'MultiTrg' directory and are familiar with how to create several 
targets within the project and set local options on the target nodes.

Here are steps that were taken to create this project:
1) Select Project|New Target from the main menu
2) Typing "My whello source" in 'Target name'
3) Selecting 'SourcePool' from the 'Target type' list
4) Hitting 'Ok'

This creates a node called 'Source Pool'.
5) Selecting that node in the Project Window
6) Hitting the Insert key to bring up the 'Add Item' dialog
7) Selecting whello.cpp, whello.rc and whello.def
8) Hitting 'Ok'

This creates three dependencies under the SourcePool node.

Now create the two targets the same way as in the MultiTrg directory's
example and delete the .cpp, .rc. and .def nodes from under both targets
by selecting all of them (Ctrl-LeftButton will select additively) and
hitting the Delete key. (Don't forget to modify the Intermediate and
Final output fields of the two whello.exe's.)

While holding down the Alt key, drag the SourcePool under the first
whello [.exe] node and release the mouse. Do the same for second whello
[.exe] node.

More notes on SourcePools
--------------------------
More advanced uses of SourcePools include nesting them, which allows
you to logically group source files without changing there location on
disk. All nested SourcePools are 'flattened' during target dependency
checking and creation time.

More notes on Reference Copies
-------------------------------
Setting options on a reference copied node *does not* affect options of 
any other reference copy of original of the node. To see this in 
effect, see the example in the 'StyleSht' directory.
