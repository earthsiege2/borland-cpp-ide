TITLE:
  OLE Word 2

DESCRIPTION:
  A trivial example of an OLE automation controller.

DEMONSTRATES:
  OleProcedure, CreateOleObject, Variant

COMMENTS:
  A file "CBUILDER.DOC" is created in the current directory with
  password "cbuilder". If it already exists, Word will prompt you
  for a password.

  Word will start flashing when it needs attention.  At that time
  just right-click on the caption bar of Word's main window, and do
  as it says.


  NOTE: This program will only function correctly with
  the US version of Microsoft Word
