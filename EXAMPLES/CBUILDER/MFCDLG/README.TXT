Keywords: VCL MFC Form 
REQUIRES C++BUILDER; WON'T BUILD OTHERWISE.

This example demonstrates using MFC and VCL together in a single
application.  One of the application menus offers a selection of 
dialog boxes to invoke.  The last command on the list invokes a
dialog box that was designed as a form in C++Builder. The .DFM and 
SIMPLECB.* files were generated within C++Builder.
