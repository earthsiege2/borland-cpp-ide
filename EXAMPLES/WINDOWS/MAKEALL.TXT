Some tools (such as the Microsoft Help Compilers) require
assistance with directing final output to a given directory. 
To accommodate this and put the resulting [.HLP] files into their 
proper directories, please make sure that you have made the
the EXAMPLES\IDE\DELIVER\DELIVER.IDE project and delivered
it to the BIN directory. Then the project will complete successfully.

Optionally, you can skip the [.hpj] compilation by
selecting 'Edit Local Options' from the [.hpj] SpeedMenu,
then by going to the 'Build Attributes' section and choosing
'Never Build'.
