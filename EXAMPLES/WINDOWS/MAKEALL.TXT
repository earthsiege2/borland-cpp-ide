Some tools (such as the Microsoft Help Compilers) seem
to need assitance in directing the final output of their
translaion to a given directory. In order to accomodate
this and put the resulting [.hlp] files into their proper
directories, please make sure that you have made the
the examples\ide\deliver\deliver.ide project and delivered
it into the bin directory. That will allow that this project
to complete successfully.

Optionally you may chose to skip the [.hpj] compiliation
by selecting 'Edit Local Options' from the [.hpj]'s SpeedMenu,
going to 'Build Attributes' section and selecting
'Never Build'.
