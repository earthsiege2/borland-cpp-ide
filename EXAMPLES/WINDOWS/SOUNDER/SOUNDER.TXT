The Sounder example demonstrates the use of Multimedia commands in 
a WIN32 application. This example will only run on Windows NT.

Mulitmedia commands are currently not supported in WIN32S.
If you launch this example on Windows 3.1 with WIN32S, you will
get an error message and the application will exit.

This example does require a sound card and appropriate driver to be
installed on your NT system.
