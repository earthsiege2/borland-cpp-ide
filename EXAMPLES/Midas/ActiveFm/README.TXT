TITLE:
    EmpX

DESCRIPTION:
    This program demonstrates using client datasets in an ActiveForm.
    The ActiveForm in this project works just like the client in the
    EmpEdit project.

DEMONSTRATES:
    + ActiveX Library
    + ActiveX Form
    + Web Deployment

COMMENTS:
    Before compiling and using this Active Library, you need to compile
    and run the EmpSrvr project from the EmpEdit example.  Once the EmpSrvr
    application is registered, you need to connect the TDCOMConnection control
    to the server.  To do this, set the DCOMConnection1's ServerName property
    to EmpSrvr.EmpServer_BCB.
