Source files for the example programs presented in the standard library 
tutorial.  

The files are as follows:

alg1.cpp through alg6.cpp:
	These are example programs for the generic algorithms described
	in Section 12.  

alg7.cpp:
	Ordered collection generic algorithms from Section 13.

calc.cpp:
	The RPN calculator example from Section 10.2.1

complx.cpp:
	Complex Number example program.	Section 14.3

concord.cpp:
	Concordance program from section 9.3.3
	Note that this program reads the standard input.

graph.cpp: 
	Graph program from section 9.3.2.  This does not link on Borland C++
	because the mangled name of a map of strings is too long, so it is
	excluded from the Borland make file.

icecream.cpp:
	Event-driven simulation from section 11.3.1

radix.cpp:
	radix sort program from section 7.3

sieve.cpp:
	prime sieve program from section 5.3.

spell.cpp:
	spelling check program from section 8.3

tele.cpp:
	telephone database program from section 9.3.1.

widwork.cpp:
	widget works inventory program, from section 6.3
