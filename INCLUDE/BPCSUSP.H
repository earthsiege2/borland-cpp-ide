//// bpcsuspend.h - header file for interface that allows external apps
//       to request that the bpc video server release all of its devices and
//       shutdown its directshow graph.  

// USAGE:
// in order to request that the bpc subsystem release its devices
// create an instance of the CBPCSuspend class
// to check if this succeeded use the IsBPCSuspended member function.  if IsBPCSuspended returns false 
// then that means that there are active bpc video clients and you must treat this as you would a
// device busy or device open type of failure.
// when you are done with the devices destroy the CBPCSuspend class and this will notify vidsvr
// that it can resume using the devices and return to background data capturing
//
// NOTE: you must compile vidsvr.odl and include the resulting .h before including this file
// NOTE: you must have initialized com prior on this thread prior to using this object.
// 
// CLSID_BPCSuspend comes from the header file generated from compiling vidsvr.odl
// IBPCSuspended comes from the header file generated from compiling vidsvr.odl

// theory of operation:
// by using GetActiveObject instead of CoCreateInstance we don't force vidsvr to be loaded just to find
// out that it wasn't running in the first place.
// by returning an object that must be released to free the devices so that vidsvr can continue background
// data capture we utilize COM to manage this resource.  this means that if the external app that requested
// the devices crashes or leaks then the suspension object will be automatically released and 
// vidsvr can resume using the devices without requiring a system reboot or some other unfriendly intervention.
