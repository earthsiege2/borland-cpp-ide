1. General Application Deployment
===========================================================
C++Builder 6 applications do not require a runtime interpreter
DLL. All you have to provide is your .EXE file and any DLLs
or BPLs that it calls. For simple applications you can
distribute a standalone .EXE file. If you have used runtime
packages with your application, be sure to include all
required BPLs with the distribution. If you build using the dynamic
Run-Time Library, you will also have to distribute one or more of the
Run-Time Library DLLs CC3260.DLL or CC3260MT.DLL and the memory
manager Dlls BORLNDMM.DLL, BCBMM.DLL or DELPHIMM.DLL. Applications
that use MFC may also need BFC42.DLL or BFC42D.DLL.  Those using
STLPort will require redistribution of STLP45.DLL and/or STLPMT45.DLL.

For applications that use the Borland Database Engine (BDE),
you must use a Borland-certified installation/deployment utility,
such as InstallShield Express.

If you use InstallShield, treat .BPL (package) files just
like other DLLs. From the Setup Checklist, open Groups and
Files, then click Add Group. You can create a group called
"Packages" for BPLs; to install packages in the
Windows\System directory, choose <WINSYSDIR> as the desti-
nation directory. (We recommend installing .DLL and .BPL
files in the <Operating System>\System or \System 32directory.)
Then click Launch Explorer to select the .BPL files you want to deploy.

If the license for C++Builder that accompanied this file was acquired
as an educational or for scholarly purpose, distribution of any files for any
commercial or institutional use is prohibited.  Performing research in
an educational setting or producing coursework required in pursuit of
a degree or certificate of credential at an educational institution is
permitted.

2. Components and Packages
===========================================================
2.1 Distributing Custom Packages
--------------------------------
If you distribute C++Builder 6 packages to other developers, be
sure to supply both .BPI and any .LIB files to which your packages
link.

You will probably
also want to include .OBJ and .DCU files as well as documentation.
Package Collection (.DPC) files, created with the Package
Collection Editor, offer a convenient way to distribute all
the files associated with a package or group of packages.

2.2 Borland Runtime Packages
----------------------------
In accordance with the General Terms That Apply to Compiled
Programs and Redistributables, you may redistribute
Borland-supplied runtime packages only for the purpose of
executing application programs created with C++Builder. You may
not modify these packages in any way. By default the
redistributable runtime packages are installed in the
system-files directory of the computer (commonly this is
the \windows\system on Windows9x, \WINNT\System32 on
Windows NT, 2000 or XP computers).

Although this software may include packages other than
those listed below, only the packages identified below
as redistributable may be redistributed by you.  The package
filenames identified below should be considered to be
case-insensitive.

You may NOT redeploy Borland-supplied design-time-only
packages. You may not recompile or redistribute any
Borland-supplied components or libraries for use by other
developers.

Packages that you develop may not have the same names as
Borland-supplied packages. If you distribute component
libraries or other packages, it is recommended that you
avoid using the default DCLUSR60 package name, since this
will cause naming conflicts with other developers.

2.6 Restrictions on CLXDisplay API (Qt.pas) Usage
---------------------------------------------------
CLXDisplay API, the Qt.pas interface to the Qt runtime, is
only licensed for use in VisualCLX applications or a
component that derives from TControl in the QControls
unit. A VisualCLX application is an application that
uses the TApplication object and uses at least one
component derived from TControl. You are not licensed
to use Qt.pas to create applications or components that
exclusively call the Qt.pas interfaces. A separate commercial
development license from Trolltech
is required for use of Qt.pas in any manner other than
authorized above.

3. The Borland Database Engine (BDE)
===========================================================
C++Builder 6 applications that use the Borland Database Engine
(BDE) to effect database access require that you distribute
the BDE with the application.

In accordance with the Additional License Terms for BDE,
you may distribute the BDE files with your application
using an Borland-certified Redistributable Install program
such as InstallShield Express or another compliant install
program. You may redistribute only those BDE files selected
by the Borland-certified installation program.

Additionally, Borland supplies a BDE merge module that is an
approved mechanism for deploying BDE.  This module may be used
with any Windows Installer (MSI) development tool (such as
InstallShield for Windows Installer, Wise for Windows
Installer and others).  The merge module includes the base
BDE and SQL Links appropriate to the version of C++Builder
purchased.

See the BDE Links deployment notes in the file
BDEDEPLOY.TXT (found in the BDE directory) for specific
information regarding deploying the BDE with database
applications created in C++Builder.


4. ActiveX Controls (OCXs)
===========================================================
C++Builder includes ActiveX Controls (OCXs) for use in your
applications:

  o Chart FX, copyright SoftwareFX Inc.
  o VisualSpeller Control, copyright Visual Components,
    Inc.
  o Formula One (spreadsheet), copyright Visual Components,
    Inc.
  o First Impression (VtChart), copyright Visual
    Components, Inc.

The version of each of these OCXs shipped with C++Builder may
be redistributed in custom C++Builder applications. Such
redistribution is subject to the General Terms That Apply
to Compiled Programs and Redistributables.


5. Sample Images
===========================================================
C++Builder includes a library of redistributable bitmap images
normally installed in the subdirectory:

  \Program Files\Common Files\Borland Shared\Images

C++Builder also includes a database EVENTS.DB with licensed
images from PhotoDisc. The images in this database are
copyright PhotoDisc, Inc. 1995 and may not be
redistributed.


6. InterBase Deployment
===========================================================
6.1 Applications that Use the 32-bit Local InterBase
----------------------------------------------------
C++Builder Enterprise and Professional editions include a
development license for Local InterBase. They do not,
however, include rights for deployment or redistribution of
any InterBase component. To deploy InterBase applications,
you must purchase Deployment Kits, available separately
from Borland. For more information on InterBase, see
Borland's World Wide Web site at http://www.borland.com,
or contact your local Borland sales office.

6.2 The 32-bit Five-user InterBase Server
-----------------------------------------
C++Builder Enterprise contains a development license for the
32-bit five-user InterBase Server for Windows.  Purchase of
C++Builder, however, does not include deployment or
redistribution rights for any InterBase Server files. Customers
who wish to deploy InterBase Server applications must separately
purchase individual copies of the InterBase Server, available
separately from Borland. For more information on InterBase,
see Borland's World Wide Web site at http://www.borland.com,
or contact your local Borland sales office.


7. DataSnap Applications (formerly MIDAS)
===========================================================
The C++Builder 6 Enterprise edition includes a development
license for the DataSnap. DataSnap comprises the Business
ObjectBroker, the Remote DataBroker, and the
ConstraintBroker Manager (SQL Explorer). Purchase of C++Builder
Enterprise edition, however, does not include deployment
rights for this software. Customers who wish to deploy
applications that use DataSnap must purchase a separate
license for each server on which DataSnap is installed.

Handle the installation of the executable and related files
for a multi-tier application the same as for general
applications. Some DataSnap files may need to be installed on
the client computer and others on the server computer.

For the Remote DataBroker and ConstraintBroker portions of
DataSnap, the file MIDAS.DLL must be installed onto the
client computer and registered with Windows. On the server
computer, the files MIDAS.DLL and STDVCL40.DLL must be
installed and registered for the Remote DataBroker and
DBEXPLOR.EXE for the ConstraintBroker. Installation
programs such as InstallShield Express automate the process
of registering these DLLs. To manually register the DLLs,
use the TRegSvr demo application or the Microsoft utility
REGSERV32.EXE (not included with all Windows versions).

A server deployment license is not required for deploying
MIDAS.DLL and STDVCL40.DLL in an application in which
the client and server reside on the same machine. These two
files are the Client Dataset Redistributables referred to
in the License Statement.

For more information on DataSnap, see Borland's World Wide Web
site at the URL below, or contact your local Borland sales
office.

  http://www.borland.com/datasnap/

8. WebSnap Application Deployment
===========================================================
If you created your application as a Web App Debugger
executable, you will first have to convert it to an
ISAPI DLL, CGI executable, or Apache Shared Module. To
deploy your DLL or EXE to a web server, you will have to
place your application in a directory that has executable
rights. With Internet Information Services (IIS), this is
typically C:\Inetpub\Scripts. For each WebModule in your
application, you must copy the associated HTML file to the
same directory as your EXE/DLL. By default, the associated
HTML file is simply the WebModule unit's name with .html
as the extension.

Additionally, you must register both WebBrokerScript.tlb
and stdvcl40.dll on the web server. TLB files cannot be
registerd with the Microsoft regsvr32 program, but must
be registerd with tregsvr, located in the C++Builder bin
directory. You can copy tregsvr to the web server, and
register the files with:

tregsvr WebBrokerScript.tlb

and

tregsvr stdvcl40.dll

Finally, WebSnap applications require the Microsoft Active
Scripting Engine in order to work. It is included with
Internet Explorer 5 and later, and is installed by default on Windows
2000 or later machines. To download the Scripting Engine, visit:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/

9.  VisiBroker
===========================================================
This product does not include deployment rights for the
VisiBroker CORBA ORB.  When deploying an application
requiring CORBA services, you must first obtain VisiBroker
Deployment licenses, available separately from Borland.

For more information on VisiBroker, see Borland's World
Wide Web site at the URL below, or contact your local
Borland sales office.

   http://www.borland.com/visibroker/


10. SQL Links Deployment (Enterprise edition only)
===========================================================
See the BDE/SQL Links deployment notes in the file
BDEDEPLOY.TXT (found in the BDE directory) for specific
information regarding redeploying the SQL Links software.
(SQL Links is available only with the C++Builder 6 Enterprise
edition.)


11. JPEG Compression Software
===========================================================
The C++Builder CD includes software for JPEG image compression
and decompression. This software and its source code are
distributed by the Independent JPEG Group and copyrighted
by Thomas G. Lane. For conditions of distribution and use,
see the README file that accompanies the software.


12. Data Compression Library (zlib)
===========================================================
The C++Builder media includes zlib data compression software. This
software and its source code are copyrighted by Mark Adler
and others and may be used and distributed subject to the
conditions specified in the file zlib.h.


13. Windows Common Controls
===========================================================
The Windows common controls are provided in a Microsoft-approved
installation file, 50comupd.exe.  This file contains the
common controls library, comctl32.dll.  The only approved
method for updating end-user computers is by the use of
50comupd.exe.  This file can be redistributed with applications
built using C++Builder.  No other method is permitted.

14. C++Builder Utilities
===========================================================
The utility programs included with C++Builder 6 may NOT be
redistributed with deployed applications. These utility
