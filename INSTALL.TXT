SECTION -0- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===============================

Before installing BC++ 4.5 please review the minimum system
requirements listed below:

A) Minimum Installation (no IDE)

        4 MB Extended Memory
        Intel 386 or higher
        PC-DOS (MS-DOS) 4.01 or later
        Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later
        3.5" High Density Disk Drive or CD ROM Drive

B) Full Installation (16-bit/32-bit capability):

        8 MB Total Memory
        Intel 386 or higher
        DOS 4.01 or later
        Windows 3.1 or later
        VGA
        Win32s (included with BC++ 4.5)
        3.5" High Density Disk Drive or CD ROM Drive

C) Hard disk requirements (may vary due to cluster size)

        CD-ROM configuration (tools run from CD):  25 mb
        DOS command line configuration:            25 mb
        16-bit Windows configuration (incl. IDE):  75 mb
        32-bit Windows configuration (incl. IDE):  75 mb
        Full installation:                        100 mb
        

NOTE: On a compressed hard disk the installation process
might need additional hard disk space, depending on how the
installation affects the overall compression ratio.




SECTION -1- BOOTING CLEAN
=========================

It is highly recommended that you boot clean before installing
BC++ 4.5.  Booting your system with a clean configuration will
eliminate many potential software conflicts that might cause the
installation to fail.  You will need one blank floppy diskette.
After making the disk bootable, use a text editor (EDIT, for
example) to create and/or modify the files mentioned below.  

Note that the instructions below assume that DOS is installed
into the directory C:\DOS, and that Windows in installed into the
directory C:\WINDOWS.

Twice below there is a statement "<insert required drivers here>".  
For the purposes of the clean boot, a "required driver" is one
that must be loaded so that you can access the devices necessary
to complete the installation.  For example, for a CD-ROM
installation, MSCDEX (or equivalent) would be a required driver;
if you are installing onto a network drive, your network drivers
are required.  Examples of things that are not "required drivers"
include EMM386.EXE, QDPMI.SYS, and SMARTDRV.EXE.  If you are
unsure whether a driver is required, assume it is not.

A) Making a Boot Disk

It is suggested that you create the clean boot configuration on a
floppy disk, in order to minimize the number of changes made to
your normal system configuration.

In most cases, inserting a blank diskette in drive A: and typing
the command

    format a: /s

will work.  See your DOS documentation for more details
on creating a bootable floppy.


B) Contents of CONFIG.SYS (on boot floppy)

    DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
    FILES=40
    <insert REQUIRED drivers here>

C) Contents of AUTOEXEC.BAT (on boot floppy)

    REM the path statement should be copied verbatim
    REM from your current AUTOEXEC.BAT.  The line included
    REM below is an example only.

    PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;C:\BC45\BIN

D) Changes to C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI and C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI

Before modifying these files, be sure to back them up: Windows
will not properly start if they are corrupted (i.e., copy WIN.INI
WIN.BAK).

    1)  Edit WIN.INI

    2)  Find all lines that begin with either "load=" or "run="
    and place a single ";" at the start of each line.

    3)  Edit SYSTEM.INI

    4)  If the line that starts with "shell=" is set to
    something besides "progman.exe", place a ";" at the start of
    the line, and replace it with "shell=program.exe" (no
    quotes).  



SECTION -2- BEFORE YOU BEGIN
============================

A)  Boot Clean

    It is highly recommended that you boot clean before
    installing BC++ 4.5. Booting your system with a clean 
    configuration will eliminate any potential software 
    conflicts that might arise during installation. Refer to
    Section 1 for instructions on how to boot clean.

B)  Upgrading Issues

    If you are upgrading from BC4 or BC4.02, before removing the
    old version of the compiler, be sure to save the RTL, BIDS,
    and OWL .DLLs if you have any executables that depend upon
    them.  Otherwise, you will need to rebuild those application
    with the new libraries.

    If you will be using OWL 1 or Turbo Vision 1, you must keep
    the source code for ClassLib, TV, and OWL 1 on your computer
    so that you can rebuild them with BC++ 4.5.  Remove the
    previous version of BC++ from your PATH statement in your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT.

    For other upgrading issues (especially with regard to the
    Paradox Engine), please see the file BC45\DOC\COMPAT.TXT.

C)  Network Installation

    If you are installing BC++ 4.5 on a network, you may wish to
    consult Technical Information Document number 1738.  For
    information on how to receive this document, refer to
    Section 5.

D)  Hard Drive Installation

    If you have about 40 megabytes of hard drive space in
    addition to what is required for the installation of BC++
    4.5, you may want to install the product from your hard
    drive.  The primary advantage of a hard drive installation is
    speed:  expect to halve the time it takes to install as
    compared to an installation from floppy disks.  To install
    from hard drive, make a temporary directory and then XCOPY
    each disk into that directory; if you have the CD, XCOPY the
    INSTALL directory.  Then, run the INSTALL.EXE from the
    temporary directory rather than from the installation disk.



E) Installing Under Windows NT, OS/2, or Windows 95

    1)  The install will fail if you enter any paths that use long
        file names (more than 8 letters in the name, more than 3
        letters in the extension, or exceeding a total path length
        of 128 characters).

    2)  When installing under OS/2, WinOS/2 should be run in either
        a full screen WinOS/2 session, or from Program Manager.
        Also, the session must be in Enhanced Mode rather than 
        Standard.  To check this, see the WinOS/2 settings for
        the appropriate icon.  Note that if run from a full screen
        session (preferred), near the end of the installation,
        focus will switch to the OS/2 desktop as a DOS program is
        run; when this program exits, OS/2 will not return the
        focus back to the WinOS/2 session, you will need to do
        this manually.
    
    3)  Under Windows NT, To allow for the proper execution of OLE
        applications that use .DLLs in the Borland C++ "bin"
        directory, you must update the system path.  To modify the
        system path, you must have Administrator privileges or login
        as the Administrator.

        To update the system path,
        1)  In Program Manager, double-click the Control Panel
            icon.
        2)  In the Control Panel group, double-click the System
            icon.
        3)  In the System Environment Variable box, select the
            "Path=" statement.
        4)  In the Value box, add the path to the Borland C++
            "bin" directory.  For example, if you installed 
            Borland C++ in the C:\BC45 directory, type
            C:\BC45\BIN at the end of the path statement.
        5)  Choose Set.
        6)  Choose OK.

    4)  WINRUN.EXE will be installed in your StartUp Program
        Manager group.  Because OS/2 (as of version 3.0) does
        not provide support for Windows VxDs, WINRUN.EXE will
        issue an error message and fail to load.  Simply remove
        it from the StartUp group to prevent future error messages.

    5)  To run 16-bit protected-mode programs (bcc, tlink) under
        an NT command prompt, you need to add the following line 
        to CONFIG.NT:

        ntcmdprompt

        Under the default NT command-line prompt, DOS COMMAND.COM
        is run after returning from a TSR (such as RTM.EXE, which
        bcc and tlink load). Adding the above line will cause the
        original NT CMD.EXE to be run.

    6)  Under Windows 95, add the following line to your
        AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        SET RTM=EXTMAX 12288


SECTION -3- TROUBLESHOOTING INSTALLATION PROBLEMS
=================================================

This section explains common errors encountered during
installation. System configuration and software conflicts
might cause the installation process to fail. If the
installation fails, follow the instructions in Section 1
on how to boot clean.  This will eliminate many possible
software conflicts.  Also, check the integrity of the file
systems on your hard drive using a utility like CHKDSK or
SCANDISK; proceeding with an installation while file system
errors are present increases the risk of a failure resulting in
data loss.  If these two steps do not solve the
problem, or you encounter a problem not mentioned here, 
contact Borland Technical Support.

A)  Internal Error, Unable to Start Install

    1) Error -2:  The install program was unable to create a
    temporary directory needed for the installation.  Check that
    if you have either TMP or TEMP set as environment variables
    that they point to a valid directory on a drive with at least
    two megabytes of free space (four megabytes if you are using
    disk compression).  If you do not have a TMP or a TEMP
    environment variable set, the install will place it's
    temporary files in the directory WINDOWS\BORLAND.TMP.

    2) Error -3:  There was an error while copying and decompressing
    the file INSTRUN.EXE, which is used to launch phase two of
    the installation.  Check that there is sufficient free space
    in your temporary directory (see above) and boot the machine
    clean.  Also, a hard drive installation is often helpful.

    3) Error -69:  The execution of INSTRUN.EXE (phase two of
    the installation process) failed.  Probable causes:  file
    corruption (see above), memory corruption (see the section on
    booting clean).

B)  Data Integrity or Bad Sector on Disk Errors

    If you receive either one of these error messages, you
    may need to get a replacement disk set. If running a
    disk checking utility (such as "chkdsk" or "scandisk") 
    reports a bad sector or data integrity problem contact
    Borland's Disk Replacement Line at (800-621-3132). 
    Otherwise, see the Section 1 on booting clean, and if 
    the problem persists, contact Borland Technical Support
    (408-461-9133) for further assistance.

    Outside the US, contact your local Borland representative.

C) Install Program Terminates Prematurely 

   If the install program stops for no apparent reason without 
   error messages, it is possible that certain support files
   are write protected. To check this, do the following:

          1) Go to your WINDOWS directory
          2) Type  attrib *.*
          3) Check for the "r" attribute. If any file has this
             flag set, then you must clear it by typing:
                     attrib -r <filename>
          4) Repeat steps 2-3 for the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

D)  General Protection Fault/Unhandled Exception 

    If you encounter a General Protection Fault or Unhandled
    Exception during installation, try the following steps:

    - Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements.
      Refer to Section 0 for a list of the minimum
      installation requirements.

    - Boot your system with a clean configuration. Refer to
      Section 1 for instructions on how to boot clean.

    - Perform an integrity check on your hard drive, using
      a utility such as "SCANDISK" or "CHKDSK".

    - Turn off Disk Caching and Video/Shadow RAM in CMOS.
      Refer to the documentation for your computer.

E)  Win32s Issues

    Win32s is for use with Windows 3.1 or 3.11 only.
    Specifically, it is not required for a Win32
    operating system, and will not work with OS/2.

    Most of the time, if the Win32s setup utility fails, it is
    because the setup program had difficulty detecting a
    sufficient amount of virtual memory.  Ensure that you have
    virtual memory enabled in Windows, and that you are running
    in "Enhanced Mode."  To reinstall Win32s, either:

        - Insert the 27th disk in your floppy drive and
        execute SETUP.EXE

        or

        - Run SETUP.EXE from the INSTALL directory on your
        CD-ROM.



SECTION -4- CD-ROM INFORMATION
==============================

This section discusses a few issues that pertain specifically to
using BC45 from a CD-ROM.  If you did a "full installation", this
section is not relevant.

A)  "Drive not ready" When Starting Windows

At startup, Windows will check the status of all of the drives
listed in your PATH.  If a CD is not loaded in your CD-ROM drive
at this time, Windows will complain that the drive is not ready.
The following steps will minimize the number of "Drive not ready"
errors related to using BC45 from your CD, and will also ensure
that when starting Windows the contents of the CD loaded in your
drive will not be important.

    1)  Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and ensure that the
    \BC45\BIN directory on the CD is the last element of your
    path.  You will likely find a line that reads:

            PATH D:\BC45\BIN;%PATH%

    Change it to:

            PATH %PATH%;D:\BC45\BIN

    and be sure that it is the last line in the file that sets
    any component of your path.
        
    2)  Copy the files WINDPMI.386 and TDDEBUG.386 from the
    \BC45\BIN directory on the CD to your configuration file
    directory and modify your WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI file. For
    example,

           COPY D:\BC45\BIN\WINDPMI.386 C:\BC45\BIN
           COPY D:\BC45\BIN\TDDEBUG.386 C:\BC45\BIN

    Be sure to modify your Windows SYSTEM.INI file to reflect
    these changes. For example, change:

           [386Enh]
           device=D:\BC45\BIN\WINDPMI.386
           device=D:\BC45\BIN\TDDEBUG.386
    to:
           [386Enh]
           device=C:\BC45\BIN\WINDPMI.386
           device=C:\BC45\BIN\TDDEBUG.386

B) Command-Line Compiler Issues

Because the CD-ROM drive is a read-only device, special issues
are raised when using the command-line compiler included with
BC++ 4.  While the Windows-hosted tools can find BCW.INI in the
Windows directory, the command-line tools rely on finding
configuration files in either your current working directory or
in their home directory.  (E.g., C:\BC45\BIN)

The CD contains default configuration files that set these paths
to D:\BC45\INCLUDE and D:\BC45\LIB. If you need to change these
entries, or want to add options to the configuration files,
you'll need to copy the configuration files into the directory
where you run the tools and then edit the directory options.
Configuration files are simple ASCII files and can be edited in
most text editors. These files include TURBOC.CFG, TLINK.CFG,
BCC32.CFG, TLINK32.CFG. Also, BCROOT.INC defines a macro that is
commonly used in make files. You can override this value by
setting an environment variable for BCROOT.


C) Difficulty Finding Files

If you're experiencing difficulty finding files when running
BC45, check your PATH statement.  Although having the PATH
statement point to the CD-ROM drive all the time will cause
Windows to complain "Drive not ready" if a CD is not in the
CD-ROM drive, sometimes when compiling if the CD-ROM drive is not
on the PATH and the files that are needed are on the BC45 CD, the
compiler will not be able to find those files. Thus you might
need to add the CD Drive to your PATH; to minimize complaints
with "Drive not ready" errors, be sure that it is at the end.  If
the path is correct, make sure your project directories are
valid. If you are relying on the CD-ROM drive to provide certain
library files, make sure the appropriate drive/path combination
is present in the directories section of your project.  

D)  Compiling and Running the Examples

All of the example projects will write their output by default to
the current directory.  While this is ideal when the examples are
installed to the hard drive, the read-only nature of a CD-ROM
will cause the compilation to fail.  To use any of the examples,
follow these steps:

    1) Open the project file for the example you wish to run.
    2) Select Options|Project
    3) Set the temporary and final output directories to a
       writeable location.
