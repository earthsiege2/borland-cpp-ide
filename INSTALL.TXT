SECTION 0 System Requirements
-----------------------------

A. Minimum System Requirements
------------------------------
To install and run Borland C++ 5.0, you must meet the 
following minimum system requirements:

* 16 MB RAM (24 recommended)
* 80486 processor or better
* Windows 95 or Windows NT 3.51
  (The new Microsoft shell for Windows NT, still under 
  development, is not supported.)
* 25 to 175 MB of free hard disk space (195 MB for the 
  Developer's Suite), subject to the options you choose 
  (installation options follow)

B. Minimum Installation
-----------------------
A minimum installation of Borland C++ 5.0 includes 
only the command line tools (no IDE), and provides the 
ability to work within another editor and use the command 
line compiler. This setup requires approximately 25 MB of 
hard disk space with 16-bit DOS support.

C. Full Installation
--------------------
A full installation of Borland C++ 5.0 includes all 
the tools available, the Windows-hosted IDE, and allows 
development for 16-bit DOS, 16-bit Windows, and 32-bit Windows. 
This is called the "typical" install by the installation program, 
and requires 195 MB of hard disk space.

E. Installation Procedure
-------------------------
IMPORTANT!
Do not install Borland C++ 5.0 over previously installed Borland
C++ directories. The files in this distribution will not work with
previously shipped tools and libraries. This is particularly true
for configuration files from previous shipping releases, like 
TDCONFIG.TDW and BCCONFIG.BCW.

We recommend that you do not install Borland C++ to a path that
contains spaces or long filenames.

To avoid potential conflicts when Setup installs system files, we recommend 
that you close down all other running applications before installing Borland C++.

If you previously installed Borland 4.5x, you may have
WinRun in your startup group.  If so, unload it before 
installing Borland C++ 5.0.

To install Borland C++ Release 5.0 from the CD:

Run \SETUP\BC5\SETUP.EXE.

To install the Borland C++ Development Suite from the CD:

Run \SETUP.EXE.

SECTION 1. Installation Notes
-----------------------------

A. Hard Drive Installation
--------------------------
Installing from a CD-ROM may cause synchronization 
difficulties between various pieces of hardware or certain 
hardware drivers. If you suspect that your CD-ROM drive or your
CD-ROM driver might be at fault, you can attempt a hard drive
installation.

To begin, copy the entire setup directory into a 
temporary directory on your C:\ drive. The setup directory 
contains all the files needed for the installation. 
Once these have been successfully copied, remove the CD-ROM 
driver from your system configuration by clean-booting, and 
attempt to install the product.

When running the install, remember to change the SOURCE 
directory so that it points to the temporary directory.

B. Microsoft PLUS! (tm) Issues
-------------------------
Under Windows 95 with the PLUS! Pack (tm) installed, 
some floating point errors may occur. This has been 
traced to a problem in SAGE.DLL, a part of System Agent. 
If this problem occurs, turn OFF System Agent and 
download Plusupd1.exe from:

* Microsoft Network (under mssupport),
* CompuServe (GO MSL), or
* Microsoft's anonymous FTP server 
  (ftp.microsoft.com, Softlib/Mslfiles directory).

Run Plusupd1.exe and follow the instructions on the screen.

C. Windows NT New Shell
-----------------------
The new shell under development for Windows NT is NOT 
supported by this release of the Borland C++ compiler for DOS, 
16-bit Windows, and 32-bit Windows.

D. CD Installation
-----------------
If you choose the CD installation option or the Custom CD 
Installation option, you will not be able to install any of the 
additional products available (such as CodeGuard). This is 
because a CD installation leaves the majority of the product 
in write-protected files on the CD-ROM, rather than on the 
hard drive. These write-protected files need to be modified 
to install any of the additional software.

E. Files Changed During Installation
------------------------------------
The following files are changed during installation:

1. WIN.INI  (under Windows 95)  REMIND.EXE is added to the 
   LOAD line of the WIN.INI file:
 
   load=C:\BC5\PIPELINE\REMIND.EXE  
   (where C:\BC5 is where you loaded BC5)
  
   OR
   
   Registry key (under Windows NT):
   \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS NT
    \CurrentVersion\Windows 

2. SYSTEM.INI  A change is made to the [386Enh] section:
   [386Enh]
   device=C:\BC5\BIN\TDDEBUG.386
   (where C:\BC5 is where you loaded BC5)

3. WINHELP.INI  Lists all of the Help files that were installed.

4. OWL.INI is installed.

5. The following files are created if they are not on the system or 
   modify them if they already exist:

   TD.INI
   WORKSHOP.INI
   BCW5.INI
   TDW.INI

F. Files Added at First Startup
-------------------------------
Borland C++ creates SPX, SPP, and various configuration 
files in the SCRIPT and BIN directories upon first startup:

debug.spx 
default.spp
default.spx 
edit.spx
ed_dflt.spx 
*.CFG, *.BCW, *.DSW, *.MBT, *.MRT

SPX files are compiled versions of cScript files.  
The other runtime files store project and desktop settings 
and other configuration information.  


G. Removing Registration Reminder
---------------------------------
If you run the online registration module during Setup and then 
cancel without completing registration, the module adds an EXE to 
your system startup files.  After 14 days, the EXE reminds you to 
register.

Windows 95 users can remove the reminder by editing WIN.INI to delete 
REMIND.EXE from the load= line.

Windows NT users should edit both WIN.INI and the system registry. 
Launch REGEDT32.EXE.  Choose the HKEY_CURRENT_USER window.  Browse to 
this key: Software\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows.  Edit the value 
named "load." 


---------------------------------------------
SECTION 2. Changing Your System Configuration
---------------------------------------------
Although Windows 95 and Windows NT are much more stable 
than Windows 3.1, it is still recommended that you change
the configuration of your system when installing new software.
Each operating system has its own method, as follows.

A. "Clean Boot" under Windows 95
--------------------------------
Under Windows 95, the method of obtaining a "clean boot"
is through the use of Safe Mode, a boot option provided by 
Microsoft to aid Windows 95 users.
1. Shut down the machine and reboot it.
2. Before the Windows 95 splash screen appears, press and hold 
   down F8.
3. Select Safe Mode from the menu and press Enter.
   You are now running under Windows 95 Safe Mode. 
 
B. "Clean Boot" under Windows NT
--------------------------------
To perform a "clean boot" on an NT machine:
1. Shut down the machine and reboot it.
2. When the OS choice menu appears, select number 2, 
   Windows NT Workstation 3.51 [VGA mode].
Windows NT will then boot itself in a clean mode.


------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3. Troubleshooting Installation Error Messages
------------------------------------------------------

A. Startup Error Messages
-------------------------
1. "Unable to open install configuration file."

   Problem: SETUP.CFG is not present in the same
   directory as SETUP.EXE. 

   Solution: Move SETUP.CFG to the directory that SETUP.EXE
   is in.

2. "Corrupt install configuration file. Click OK to 
   exit."

   Problem: SETUP.CFG does not have the correct format.

   Solution: The configuration file for the setup 
   is corrupt. Contact the disk replacement phone 
   number listed at the end of this document to obtain 
   a new disk.

3. "Unable to load string resource (#)."

   Problem: A string resource needed by the installation 
   program cannot be found.

   Solution: If this error occurs, contact the installation
   support line number listed at the end of this document.

4. "Cannot execute SETUP.EXE (or one of its components). 
   Check to ensure that all required components 
   (INSTXTRA.PAK) are available."

   Problem: The installation program cannot execute all or
   part of the SETUP. 

   Solution: Make sure INSTXTRA.PAK is located in the same 
   subdirectory as SETUP.EXE.

5. "Cannot execute SETUP.EXE (or one of its components). 
   Check to ensure that all required components (SETUP.CFG) 
   are available."

   Problem: The installation program cannot execute all 
   or part of the SETUP.

   Solution: Make sure SETUP.CFG is located in the same 
   subdirectory as SETUP.EXE and is getting copied to the 
   TEMP directory correctly.

6. "Internal Error: -69. Unable to start installation."

   Problem: Unable to start main installation component.
   This occurs when Windows fails to launch instrun.exe. 
   This could be because:
   * The system is out of memory or resources.
   * The specified file (instrun.exe, in this case)
     was not found.
   * The specified path (usually %TEMP%) was not
     found.
   * The .exe file is invalid (non-Win32 .exe or 
     an error in the .exe image).

   Solution: Ensure that all of the above conditions have 
   been met.

B. Decompression Error Messages
-------------------------------
1. "Error during unpacking <name of .pak file>."

   Problem (possibilities):
   * The .pak file referenced in the error 
     message contains one or more files that already
     exist on the system. These files are most 
     likely write protected, or the directory they 
     reside in is write protected, or the files
     are in use by a currently running program.
   * The .pak file is corrupted on the CD or 
     diskette.
   * The installation engine is having difficulty 
     with the synchronization of the CD drive and 
     the rest of the machine. 

   Solutions:
   * Remove the write protection and then try 
     continuing with the installation.
   * Check the CD or diskette for any bad sectors,
     and call the disk replacement phone number listed 
     at the end of this document if necessary.
   * Attempt a hard drive installation as specified 
     in SECTION 1. Installation Notes.
   * Close applications running in the background.

2. "Archive file <name of file> contains a file that 
   cannot be unpacked."

   Problem: The installation engine cannot unpack one of 
   the files contained within the .pak file referenced in 
   the error message.

   Solutions: 
   * Check the disk for bad sectors and call the disk 
     replacement phone number listed at the end of this
     document.
   * Call the installation support number listed at the 
     end of this document for information about 
     attempting a manual installation of Borland C++ 5.0.

3. "Archive file <name of file> is corrupted and 
   cannot be unpacked."

   Problem: The .pak file is either corrupted on the CD 
   or it is getting corrupted in the copying process.

   Solutions: 
   * Check the CD to ensure that the .pak file there 
     is not corrupted. If the CD has a bad sector or 
     track, call the disk replacement phone number 
     provided at the end of this document.
   * If the CD is not damaged, attempt a hard drive 
     installation or attempt to slow the machine 
     down if it is encountering speed synchronization 
     problems with the hardware.

4. "Unable to write to destination file (disk full?) 
   <name of file>."

   Problem: The hard disk already contains a 
   write-protected copy of the file.

   Solution: Remove the write protection and 
   continue with the install.

5. "386 or better required to expand archive 
   <name of file>."

   Problem: Your microprocessor is running too fast.

   Solution: Try slowing down your system by taking 
   your machine out of turbo mode and disabling any
   software that speeds your machine up, such as 
   SmartDrive. If necessary, you can also disable 
   BIOS caching and shadow RAM.


---------------------------
SECTION 4. Registry Changes
---------------------------

The registry under Windows 95 and Windows NT is the 
file where information concerning all software added to the
system is logged and kept for reference. You can access the 
registry by using the registry editor (regedit or regedt32 
under Windows NT) to view and change the registry if necessary.
(There is almost never reason to do this manually.) The 
following is a list of changes made to the registry when 
Borland C++ 5.0 is installed.

A. Key Names and Values
-----------------------
Key Name: SOFTWARE\Borland\Borland C++\5.00
Class Name: <no class>

Value 9
	Name:	VDBT Source Path
	Data:	c:\BC5\SOURCE\VDBT

(This assumes that you installed to your c:\ drive. If you 
installed to a different drive, then change the drive letter 
accordingly.)

B. File Extension Associations
------------------------------
These are the file extension associations kept in the 
registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.c   = "cfile"
		 \.cpp = "cppfile"
		 \.h   = "CHeaderFile"
		 \.hpp = "CHeaderFile"
		 \.ide = "idefile"
		 \.rc  = "rcfile"
		 \.res = "resfile"
		 \.spp = "sppfile"

HKEY_USERS
\.Default\.Default\Software\Borland\Borland C++\5.0

HKEY_CURRENT_USER
