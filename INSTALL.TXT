SECTION -1-  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Before installing BC++ 4.0 please review the minimum 
system requirements listed below:

A) Minimum Installation
   4 MB Extended Memory
   Intel 386 or higher
   DOS 4.01 or later
   Windows 3.1 or later
   Approximately 9 MB hard disk space
   CD-ROM Drive

Note: If your system does not meet these minimum requirements,
      you will not be able to install and run BC++ 4.0.

B) Full Installation (16-bit/32-bit capability):
   8 MB system memory
   Intel 386 or higher
   DOS 4.01 or later
   Windows 3.1 or later
   Win32s (included in BC++ 4.0)
   Approximately 84 MB hard disk space
   CD-ROM Drive

NOTE: On a compressed hard disk the installation process
might need additional hard disk space. If you are using
a disk compression utility, refer to Section 2, part A.


SECTION -2-  INSTALLING BC++ 4.0
A) Pre-Installation Notes

1) Bad Disc?:
   If you have a bad CD, contact Borland's Disk
   Replacement line at (800) 621-3132. 

   *** If you are having trouble reading the CD and you are
   using the Corel CD Extensions, you may need updated drivers,
   available from Corel.  Alternatively, you can switch back
   to using the MSCDEX driver that comes with Windows.

2) Disk Compression:
   If you are using a disk compression utility (such as
   Stacker[tm], DoubleSpace[tm], XtraDrive[tm],
   SuperStor[tm], etc.) the estimated available hard disk
   space reported might not be sufficient to install the
   product. During installation, BC++ 4.0 copies compressed
   files onto your hard disk. Disk compression utilities
   report available hard disk space assuming that the files
   copied onto the disk can be compressed. Since the files
   that are copied by the installation program are already
   compressed, the disk compression utility cannot compress
   them any further. To solve this, you might need to free
   additional hard disk space for the installation.

3) Upgrading:  In most cases, you should remove all
   previous versions of Borland C++, including files and
   directories, from your hard drive before installing BC++
   4.0. However, if you are using Object Windows Library (OWL)
   v1.0 or Turbo Vision (TV) v1.0, you must retain the source
   code for Classlib, TV and OWL in order to recompile them under
   BC++ v4.0.

   If you decide to keep a previous version of Borland C++ on
   your system, you may wish to consult Technical Information
   Document number 1736. For information on how to receive
   this document, refer to Section 10.  

4) Network Installation:
   If you are installing BC++ 4.0 on a network, you may wish
   to consult Technical Information Document number 1738.  For
   information on how to receive this document, refer to 
   Section 11.

5) Compatibility Issues:

   -Adobe Type Manager (ATM)
     If you have ATM running on your system, you will want to
     disable it before running the install program for the
     online book services.

   -Norton Desktop For Windows (NDW)
     If you have Norton Desktop running on your system and
     have the Auto Arrange Icons option turned off,
     the BC++ 4.0 program icons may appear to be on top
     of each other once the installation process is
     complete.  Either turn on Auto Arrange (Configure |
     Quick Access | Auto Arrange) before installing or simply
     click Window | Arrange Group Icons to arrange the new
     icons within the Borland C++ 4.0 window. (Make sure the 
     Borland C++ 4.0 window is highlighted when you choose 
     Arrange Group Icons.)
   
     When installing the online book system, the Adobe program
     group that is created during the installation process 
     may be empty when running NDW. Because the book icons
     contained in the Borland C++ 4.0 Online Books group
     automatically start the Acrobat reader, the program group
     is not needed. You may delete the empty program group, or,
     if you want to add the program group, follow the instructions
     below:
        1) Choose File | New from the Program Manager menu
        2) Choose Program Group
        3) For a description, type  Adobe 
        4) Click OK
        5) Choose File | New from the Program Manager menu
        6) Choose Program Item
        7) For Command Line, type C:\ACROREAD\ACROREAD.EXE
           (Change drive/directory if defaults were modified)
        8) Click OK
        9) Repeat steps 5 and 6
       10) For Command Line, type C:\ACROREAD\README.WRI
           (Change drive/directory if defaults were modified)
       11) Click OK

   -Windows NT
     The online book services are not available when running
     BC++ 4.0 under Windows NT. This is because the online book
     reader, Adobe Acrobat, requires the use of Adobe Type
     Manager(ATM) to display the manual text. Windows NT does
     not currently support ATM.
 

B) Installation Instructions:

1. Boot Clean
   It is highly recommended that do not run other applications
   when installing BC++ 4.0. Other programs (and drivers)
   running on your computer could interfere with the
   installation process. Booting your system with a clean 
   configuration will eliminate any potential software 
   conflicts that might arise during installation. Refer to
   Section 12 for instructions on how to boot clean.

2. Installation instructions are provided in the
   installation booklet that is included with the CD. Refer to
   those directions for general installation information and
   continue referring to this document for specific
   installation information.

3. Select installation options from the install menu for
   Destination and Configuration File directories.
   "Borland C++ Destination Directory" is the directory
   where BC++ 4.0 will be installed.

   "Borland C++ Configuration File Directory" is the drive
   and directory where the BC++ 4.0 configuration files
   are stored and referenced. 

   "CD-ROM Drive:" is the drive letter used to access your
   CD-ROM drive. This letter is used when creating
   configuration files for Borland C++ 4.0. The install
   program will still install the package if this letter is
   set incorrectly, but all configuration files used by
   BC++ 4.0 will be wrong, causing file access errors.

   "Windows Directory" is the directory where Windows is 
   located. This path cannot be edited.

   The "Install ONLY configuration files to your hard disk"
   option is used to install the minimum system configuration
   to your hard disk. Most of the package will accessed from
   the CD-ROM drive. Note that selecting and deselecting this
   option will undo any changes made when customizing the
   installation using the "Customize Hard Disk Installation"
   button.

   The "Install Win32s" option will install Win32s. Refer to
   Section 3 for more information.

   The "Create Borland C++ Group" option will create a
   program group in Windows with the BC++ 4.0 icons. Refer
   to Section 8 for more information.

   The "LAN Windows Configuration" option is needed when you
   are installing BC++ 4.0 onto a network or run Windows
   from a network.  Refer to Section 9 for more information.

   The "Customize Hard Disk Installation" button lets you 
   customize the installation of BC++ 4.0.

SECTION -3-  CD-ROM INFORMATION

A) Specialized CD-ROM Installations
   In addition to the information provided on the CD-ROM
   version of BC++ 4.0, the CD provides you with many install
   options. Among these, three configurations are most 
   prominent. Each is a tradeoff in speed versus disk space.
   Because CD-ROMs by their design are fairly slow, you can
   choose to place certain files on your hard disk in
   an effort to speed response time.

   The three sample configurations are listed below.
   The list below is by no means exhaustive; rather
   it provides a framework from which you can customize
   your own installation. Keep in mind that the more you
   place on your hard disk, the faster the product runs.

   1) SLOWEST, LEAST HD SPACE USED (1.1M):
      This installation option uses the least hard disk
      space but provides the slowest performance. In
      addition, it requires the CD to be in the drive
      every time you start Windows. (See note at the
      end of Section 3, part A)
        Install Options:
          Check the following items:
           [Borland C++ CD-ROM Installation]
	    - Install ONLY configuration files to HD
	    - Install Win32s
	    - Create Borland C++ Group
	   (Click install)


   2) MEDIUM SPEED, MEDIUM SPACE USED (10.2M):
      This installation option uses about 10MB of hard disk
      space and provides good performance. The BC4 CD
      MUST be in the drive every time you run windows.
      (See note at the end Section 3, part A)

        Install Options:

          Check the following items:
      	[Borland C++ CD-ROM Installation]
	    - Install ONLY configuration files to HD
	    - Install Win32s
	    - Create Borland C++ Group

          (Click CUSTOMIZE HARD DISK INSTALLATION)
          (Click on BORLAND C++ TOOLS)

           [Borland C++ Tools Options]
	    - IDE
           (Click OK)
           (Click OK again)
           (Click Install)

   3) FASTEST, MOST HD SPACE USED (72.7M):
      This installation option provides the fastest
      performance and uses the most hard disk space.

        Install Options:
         (Click RESET DEFAULTS BUTTON)

         Verify the following items are checked:
          [Borland C++ CD-ROM Installation]
	    - Install Win32s
	    - Create Borland C++ Group

         Verify the following item are UNCHECKED:
          [Borland C++ CD-ROM Installation]
	    - Install Only Configuration Files
	    - Create Borland C++ Group

          (Click install)

Every user has different requirements for a compiler. You
need to identify what files you use often and place those
on the hard disk for rapid access. Doing this provides an
optimal environment for compiling code while retaining
accessibility to not-so-often used data on the CD-ROM.

Remember, in addition to the installation file set, the CD-ROM
version of BC++ 4.0 contains a full installation target set
under the \BC4 directory. This is useful when you need to access
distribution files without running the install program.

If you performed either a minimum or medium install and do
not want the BC++ 4.0 CD in the drive every time
you start Windows, copy the files WINDPMI.386 and
TDDEBUG.386 from the \BC4\BIN directory on the CD to your
configuration file directory and modify your SYSTEM.INI
file. For example, if you specified C:\BC4\BIN as your
configuration file directory and your CD-ROM drive is D:,
then the following commands would move the appropriate
files to your hard disk:
           COPY D:\BC4\BIN\WINDPMI.386 C:\BC4\BIN
           COPY D:\BC4\BIN\TDDEBUG.386 C:\BC4\BIN

Be sure to modify your Windows SYSTEM.INI file to reflect
these changes. For example:

change:
           [386Enh]
           device=D:\BC4\BIN\WINDPMI.386
           device=D:\BC4\BIN\TDDEBUG.386
to:
           [386Enh]
           device=C:\BC4\BIN\WINDPMI.386
           device=C:\BC4\BIN\TDDEBUG.386


B) Compiler Issues

   Because the CD-ROM drive is a read-only device, special
   issues are raised when using the command-line compiler
   included with BC++ 4.  While the Windows-hosted tools can
   find BCW.INI in the Windows directory, the command-line
   tools rely on finding configuration files in either your
   current working directory or in their home directory. (E.g.-
   C:\BC4\BIN)

   The CD contains default configuration files that set
   these paths to D:\BC4\INCLUDE and D:\BC4\LIB. If you
   need to change these entries, or want to add options
   to the configuration files, you'll need to copy the
   configuration files into the directory where you run
   the tools and then edit the directory options.
   Configuration files are simple ASCII files and can be
   edited in most text editors. These files include
   TURBOC.CFG, TLINK.CFG, BCC32.CFG, TLINK32.CFG. Also,
   BCROOT.INC defines a macro that is commonly used in
   make files. You can override this value by setting an
   environment variable for BCROOT.


SECTION -4-  Win32s INSTALL ISSUES
A) An Explanation of Win32s
   Win32s is a subset of Windows NT. It lets 32-bit
   programs run under Windows 3.1 (16-bit) by simulating a
   32-bit operating system. If you are using Windows 3.1,
   these extensions (provided by Microsoft) are required to
   run 32-bit applications created with BCW. Note that
   you need a minimum of 8 MB of memory to run Win32s. If
   you plan to create 32-bit applications, you must install
   these extensions. If you are unsure, and you have 8 MB of
   memory, install Win32s. The Win32s extensions don't
   affect the normal operation of Windows 3.1.

B) Adding Win32s to your system
   If you haven't installed BC++ 4.0 yet, make sure you
   check the "Install WIN32s" install option.

   If you already installed BC++ 4.0 without Win32s on
   your system, insert the CD in your drive. Run Windows
   and then choose File|Run and type d:setup <enter>.

C) Removing Win32s from your system
   To remove Win32s from your system refer to Section 2
   "Outdated versions of Win32s" in the README.TXT file.

   Remember that installation of Win32s is required if you
   plan to run 32 Bit applications under Windows 3.1.


SECTION -5-  TROUBLESHOOTING - INSTALL PROBLEMS
 
This section explains common errors encountered during
installation. System configuration and software conflicts
might cause the installation process to fail. 

To eliminate any possible software conflicts, refer to
Section 12 for instructions on how to boot clean. If
booting clean doesn't solve the problem, or you encounter a
problem not mentioned here, contact Borland Technical
Support.

A) Disk Space Requirements Do Not Change
   The CD-ROM installation requirements text at the bottom of
   the main install dialog does not change regardless of 
   options selected.  This information is presented to you
   as a reference point only.

B) Data Integrity or Bad Sector on Disk Errors
   If you receive either one of these error messages, you
   need to get a replacement disc. Contact Borland's
   Disk Replacement Line at (800-621-3132). 

C) Invalid Directory Name or Format Errors
   If you receive this error message, then it's possible
   you don't have write access to the directory you are
   installing to. Verify your access rights and try
   installing again. 

D) Install Program Terminates Prematurely 
   If the install program stops for no apparent reason without 
   error messages, it is possible that certain support files
   are write protected. To check this, do the following:
          1) Go to your WINDOWS directory
          2) Type  attrib *.*
          3) Check for the "r" attribute. If any file has this
             flag set, then you must clear it by typing:
                     attrib -r <filename>
          4) Repeat steps 2-3 for the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

E) Disk Full or Insufficient Disk Space Errors
   You could get either one of these errors if there is 
   insufficient hard disk space available to install
   BC++ 4.0. (See Section 2, Part 2 for information about
   disk compression) Here are additional suggestions:

   - Boot your system with a clean configuration. Refer to
     Section 12 for instructions on how to boot clean.

   - Make sure your system meets the minimum installation
     requirements. Refer to Section 1 for a list of the
     minimum installation requirements.

   - Make sure that at least 3Mb of disk space is available
     on the drive where you have Windows installed, regardless
     of which drive you are installing Borland C++ to.

   - Run Windows in standard mode (win /s). During a
     Windows-hosted installation process, a swap file is
     used to simulate extra memory while running Windows.
     This only happens if you are running Windows in 386
     Enhanced Mode and have virtual memory (under control
     panel) turned on. While Windows is running, the
     temporary swap file can grow dynamically thereby
     using up hard disk space. Starting Windows in standard
     mode (win /s) before installing prevents this problem.

F) GP Fault/Unhandled Exception 
   GP Fault or Unhandled Exception errors can occur for a
   variety of reasons. Possible reasons for these errors are
   explained in Technical Information Document number 649.
   Refer to Section 10 for instructions on how to obtain
   this document. Here are a few suggestions for solving
   these errors:

   - Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements.
     Refer to Section 1 for a list of the minimum
     installation requirements.

   - Boot your system with a clean configuration. Refer to
     Section 12 for instructions on how to boot clean.

   - Run Windows in standard mode (win /s) to eliminate swap
     file usage.

   - Turn off Disk Caching and Video/Shadow RAM in CMOS.
     Refer to the documentation for your computer.


SECTION -6-  TROUBLESHOOTING - RUN TIME PROBLEMS
This section describes common errors encountered when
trying to use BC++ 4.0. System configuration and software
conflicts might cause BC++ 4.0 to fail. If BC++ 4.0 fails,
you should boot your system clean to eliminate any possible
software conflicts. Refer to Section 12 for instructions
on how to boot clean. If booting clean does not solve the
problem or you encounter a problem not mentioned here,
contact Borland Technical Support.

A) Out of Memory
   If you are getting "Out of Memory" errors when running the
   command line tools, you might have exhausted your extended
   (or XMS) memory pool. This is especially true if you only
   have 2MB available extended RAM and do not have a memory
   manager that provides virtual memory. If you are
   experiencing this, please consult Technical Information
   Document number 1737. For information on how to receive
   this document, refer to Section 10.

B) GP Fault/Unhandled Exception/System Hang 
   GP Fault or Unhandled Exception errors can occur for a
   variety of reasons including: not enough memory
   available, not enough hard disk space available,
   conflicts with optimizations set in the CMOS, and
   software conflicts. Technical Information Document
   numbers 649 and 1328 address these issues. Refer to
   Section 10 for information on how to obtain these files.

C) A BC++ 4.0 Program Group Does Not Appear
   Refer to Section 8 for information about this issue.

D) File Not Found Errors
   If you are trying to compile an example program and the
   compiler cannot find certain support files (like the Object
   Windows Library DLL), make sure you rebooted your computer
   after completing the installation procedure. Rebooting will
   ensure that your DOS PATH environment variable is correctly
   set, allowing the compiler to find the support files it
   needs.


E) Turbo Debugger for Windows 
   If you experience any strange behavior from the Turbo
   Debugger, such as a garbled screen or a system hang upon
   execution or exit:
   1)  Make sure that you have the latest Windows drivers 
       for your video card.
   2)  Run TDWINI and test a different DLL to resolve a 
       possible compatibility problem with your specific 
       card.
   3)  Check TD-HELP!.TXT, TD_RDME.TXT, and README.TXT for
       additional information. 
   4)  If you are still experiencing difficulties your
       problem might not be related to the video mode. At 
       this point contact Borland Technical Support via 
       phone or online help.  Refer to Section 11 for more 
       information about online options and procedures. 


SECTION -7-  MODIFICATIONS INSTALL MAKES TO YOUR SYSTEM
This section describes the files that are added by the
install program to your Windows directory and modifications
that are made to the Windows configuration files. The
install program does not make backup copies of your WIN.INI
and SYSTEM.INI files. You may want to back these files up
before installing.

A) Standard Installation
   Files changed in the Windows directory:
   (Note, X is a system dependent value)
     WIN.INI modifications:
             [Extensions]
     added:  IDE=BCW.EXE^.IDE
             [BCW4.0 INSTALL]
             Reserved1=X:\BC4

SECTION -8-  ICONS IN THE BC++ GROUP WINDOW

A) Creating a Program Group Window for BC++ 4.0:
   
   If the Borland C++ Program Group Window didn't appear
   after installation, refer to section 10, part 5 for 
   suggestions. You can also create a new Program Group by
   choosing one of the following options:

   - Generate icons by downloading the BC4GRPS.ZIP file.
     (If you need help on downloading refer to Section 11 of
     this document.) At the DOS prompt type: PKUNZIP
     BC4GRPS.ZIP. This uncompresses the files, including a
     README.TXT file containing instructions on using the
     BC4GRPS.EXE program. PKUNZIP is a compression utility
     found on many BBS's. Refer to Section 11 of this
     document for information on obtaining this utility.


   - Manually creating the icons. Load Windows, choose
     File|New|Program Group, and click on OK. Type the
     name you want for the program group window in the
     "Description:" text box, such as Borland C++. Leave
     "Group File" line blank. Click OK. A new Window appears.
     Choose File|New|Program Item to create icons for the
     Windows programs and click OK. Select one of the
     Windows executable programs to create an icon for, such
     as BCW.EXE (you can also use the Browse button). Type
     the name of that executable program in the Description
     text box. Type the full pathname to the executable in
     the Command Line text box. Typing a pathname for the
     working directory is optional. The default is the
     WINDOWS directory. Click OK. The icon appears in 
     the active program group window. Repeat these steps
     for executable program you want to use.

SECTION -9-  LAN WINDOWS CONFIGURATION

BC++ 4.0 provides a LAN Windows Configuration option during
installation. This option must be used when you run Windows
from a network or plan to install BC++ 4.0 to a network.

If you run Windows from a network, this option is required
because access to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory is usually
read-only. If you plan to install BC++ 4.0 to a network,
the LAN Windows Configuration option centralizes the
location of these files to a location on your hard disk that
can be read from and written to.

The LAN Windows Configuration option places the following files
normally installed to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory
in the BC4\BIN subdirectory.   

BW32000C.DLL       BW320007.DLL  
BW320009.DLL       BWCC.DLL      
BWCC000C.DLL       BWCC0007.DLL  
BWCC0009.DLL       BWCC32.DLL     
CTL3DV2.DLL        CTL3D32.DLL   

You will want to ask your Network Administrator to move the
files above to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory to maintain standard
file locations.

If you are installing BC++ 4.0 to a network, you will also want
to use this option.  If users who will be running BC++ 4.0 from
the network copy the files listed above into their own 
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory on their local machine, they can be
removed from the BIN directory on the network.  Otherwise, you 
must make sure that the BC4\BIN subdirectory appears in each 
path on each machine that will run BC++ 4.0 and those DLLs 
should remain in the BIN directory. For example, if you 
installed BC++ 4.0 to the network drive W:, then each machine 
that runs BC++ 4.0 should have W:\BC4\BIN in its path.

Note that selecting the LAN Windows Configuration option
will not automatically setup BC++ 4.0 to work on a network.
Additional configuration adjustments also have to be made
to your system. To find out more about network installations,
obtain Technical Information Document number 1738. Refer to
Section 10 on how to obtain this document.


SECTION -10-  CD-ROM ISSUES
1) Speeding Up Your CD-ROM Drive
   There are a couple of things you can do to help speed up
   your CD-ROM drive. The first is increasing the number of
   buffers used for your CD-ROM driver. This is set by
   using /M: option on the Microsoft CD extension driver
   (MSCDEX). Eight buffers usually provides a good
   compromise between memory usage and performance.
     See the example MSCDEX driver line below:
        C:\DOS\MSCDEX /D:MSCD000 /L:D /M:8
   This line assumes you installed your CD-ROM driver with
   an MSCD000 label, want the CD-ROM drive to be D: and want
   to use 8 buffers.

   Another option you can choose is using a CD-ROM caching
   utility such as CD Speedway[tm] or SmartDrive[tm].
   Starting with MSDOS version 6.2, SmartDrive provides
   CD-ROM caching ability ONLY when the MSCDEX driver is
   loaded BEFORE SmartDrive. CD Speedway is an add-in
   program available from a third party and provides
   similar disk caching ability. Note that Borland doesn't
   recommend either of these utilities, they are mentioned
   here only for your reference.

2) Check your PATH statement
   Ensure your DOS PATH statement has both the hard disk
   directory where you installed BC4 and the path to the
   CD-ROM files you want. For example,
      PATH= C:\BC4\BIN;D:\BC4\BIN;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS
   This assumes you installed the product to the BC4
   directory on your C: drive and your CD-ROM drive is D:

3) Difficulty Finding Files?
   If you're experiencing difficulty finding files when
   running BC4, check your PATH statement (see above).
   If the path is correct, make sure your project
   directories are valid. If you're relying on the CD-ROM
   drive to provide certain library files, make sure the
   appropriate drive/path combination is present
   in the directories section of your project.

4) Getting CD-ROM NOT READY (or similar) error Message?
   This error message can occur when you chose a partial
   install during the installation of BC4 and the BC4 CD
   is NOT in the drive. 

   Certain support files need to be read when Windows is
   started and because a partial install was implemented,
   those files appear on the CD-ROM drive. Make sure the
   CD is in the CD-ROM drive when you start Windows. If
   this is not convenient, then you might want to place
   the required support files on your hard disk. 

   When Windows starts, it may look for two support files: 
   WINDPMI.386 and TDDEBUG.386. If you place these on your
   hard disk and edit your Windows SYSTEM.INI file to reflect
   those changes, the CD-ROM would not have be in the drive
   when you start Windows.

   The CD-ROM NOT READY error message can also occur if
   you have a CD-ROM drive in your DOS path and no CD is
   in the drive. Another possibility is an outdated MSCDEX
   driver. An outdated driver can cause access errors and
   should be replaced with the newest version. As of the
   date of this file, the latest version of MSCDEX is 2.23.

5) No Icons Appear, File/Path Settings Incorrect
   If you get blank icons (MS default icons) in the BC4
   program group, then it is possible the path for the
   program is incorrect. This could happen if an incorrect
   CD-ROM drive was specified during the install process
   or if the disk isn't accessible when trying to run the
   program. Note that the installation program installs
   BC++ even if you specified an incorrect drive letter
   for your CD-ROM drive. 

   The installation program uses the entry for your CD-ROM
   drive to create default configuration files used by the
   compiler. If you specified an incorrect CD-ROM drive,
   all of the configuration files used by the compiler
   will be wrong. If the wrong CD-ROM drive letter was
   specified, simply remove all traces of a previous
   install from your hard disk and reinstall the product
   ensuring the correct CD-ROM drive letter is used during
   the install process.


SECTION -11-  HOW TO GET A TECHNICAL INFORMATION DOCUMENT
Technical Information Documents contain tips, techniques, 
and enhanced information on using Borland development tools,
and information on commonly asked programming questions.  
Such documents often include programming examples.  These
documents can be accessed via modem or fax.	 Technical
files which contain binary modules, such as patches for 
released Borland products, are normally available only from 
those services that can be accessed by modem.  Documents can 
be accessed from the following sources:
 
A) Fax the document from Borland's TechFax Service.
   Call (800) 822-4269 from a touch-tone phone. When
   prompted, enter your FAX number, then enter the document
   number you want to receive. The document will be faxed to
   you shortly.

   -Borland-supported forums on CompuServe, Genie, BIX.
     for CIS type: go BCPPWIN 
                     or
                   go BCPPDOS 
                   and choose library 2
     for BIX type: join Borland 
     for GENIE type: Borland
 
   Below are steps to download a Technical Information
   Document from the Borland DLBBS.

   For proper display, your communication software should
   provide ANSI terminal support. Most packages provide
   VT-100 terminal emulation, which is fine for the DLBBS.
   If you're using a Windows based package, select a screen
   font (such as: Terminal) that includes extended ASCII
   characters.

   Once connected, you'll be prompted to enter your first
   and last name and a password. If you haven't used the
   service before, you'll be asked to verify your name and
   then answer a few questions. The menu-driven system
   guides you through the various product and file
   areas. You'll always receive a list of options when you
   are prompted to make any choice.

   MANEUVERING THE MAIN MENU
   First join the C++ Conference.  The Main Menu shows the
   product whose files you can access. At the Main menu, 
   type "F" to select the Files	menu.

   DOWNLOADING FILES
   Once you know the name of the file you want to download,
   type "D" for download at the File menu. When prompted,
   type the full name of the file or files. All Technical
   Information Documents have the form "TI#.ZIP". Replace
   the # with the appropriate document number. For example,
   to download Technical Information Document number 649,
   the full name of the file is TI649.ZIP.  If you do not
   know the protocol or download keys to press, refer to 
   your telecommunications manual.

   WORKING WITH DOWNLOADED FILES
   Most of the files on the Download BBS are stored and
   transferred in an archived (compressed) format and need
   to be unarchived before they can be used. If you don't
   have the unarchiving utility PKUNZIP v.204G or newer,
   download PKZ204G.EXE from the DLBBS and execute it.
   You'll receive PKUNZIP and PKZIP utilities. To unarchive
   the file, type the name of an unarchive utility
   (UNPACK, UNZIP or PKUNZIP) and then the name of the
   archived file. For example:
        PKUNZIP TI649.ZIP

SECTION -12-  BOOT CLEAN
This section describes the process of "booting clean" on
IBM PC's and compatible computers with DOS and/or windows.
This document assumes you have MS-DOS version 5.00 or higher.
"Booting Clean" is the process of booting without loading
device drivers and TSRs that can cause memory conflicts.

These device drivers and TSRs are usually loaded in two
files (AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS typically located on
the root directory of your hard disk). The safest
method of booting clean is to create a "bootable" floppy
disk in drive A:. See the "Making a Boot Disk" section
below.

If you are using a program that runs under Microsoft
Windows, then you might need to make changes to some Windows
configuration files in order to ensure a "clean system
configuration" under Windows. The two files you will need
to examine are WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI. These files are
located in the WINDOWS subdirectory on your hard disk. The
changes that you will need to make to these files (if any)
are outlined below. 

Making a Boot Disk In order to make a bootable floppy disk,
follow the instructions below. NOTE: These instructions
assume that your hard disk is C: and your DOS and WINDOWS
subdirectories appear on this disk. (Most cases)

     1) Place a blank disk in drive A:
     2) type  format a: /s (format the disk)

At this point you now have a bootable floppy disk
containing an ASCII editor (EDIT.COM) and a high memory
driver (HIMEM.SYS). Using EDIT, ensure your AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS look like one of the configuration choices
below. 

Your "clean" system configuration should be exactly like
one of the choices below except replace "<Insert Required
drivers here>" with any required drivers. The ONLY
required drivers are, for example, disk compression and/or
hard disk access drivers. This does not include mouse
drivers and disk caching utilities such as SmartDrive.

Clean Configuration: DOS 5.0 and DOS 6.x running Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------
   1)  Insert your "bootable floppy" in drive A:
   2)  type  A:
   3)  At the A> prompt type  edit CONFIG.SYS
   4)  Type in the following:
          <Insert Required drivers here>
          DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS
          FILES=40
          BUFFERS=40
   5)  Exit the editor (Alt-F, then X, then Y)
   6)  Type  edit AUTOEXEC.BAT
   7)  Type in the following:
          <Insert Required drivers here>
          PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;C:\BC4\BIN
          PROMPT $P$G
   8)  Exit the editor (Alt-F, then X, then Y)
   9)  type  C: 
  10)  type  CD \WINDOWS
  11)  type  copy WIN.INI WIN.BAK
  12)  type  copy SYSTEM.INI SYSTEM.BAK
  13)  type  edit WIN.INI
  14)  Make sure that the "load=" and "run=" lines in your
       WIN.INI file look like the following:
          ------------
          [windows]
          spooler=yes
          load=
          run=
          Beep=yes
          ------------
  15)  Exit the editor (Alt-F, then X, then Y)
  16)  type  edit system.ini
  17)  Ensure that your "shell=" line in your SYSTEM.INI file
        looks like the following:
          ------------
          [boot]
          shell=progman.exe
          ------------
  18)  Exit the editor (Alt-F, then X, then Y)
  19)  Make sure your "Bootable floppy" is in drive A: and
        reboot your computer.
