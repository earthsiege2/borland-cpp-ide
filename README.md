# Borland C++ Archive

This repository contains at the moment an archive of the IDE directory of:

* Borland C++ 4.0
* Borland C++ 4.5
* Borland C++ 5.0
* Borland C++ 5.02
* Borland C++ Builder 5.x
* Borland C++ Builder 6.x

The source for all of the ISOs was WinWorldPC, an abandonware archive. I
have left out everything else (e.g. installers, demos, other products like
BDE).

# Whom is this repository for?

This repository is extremely useful for everyone who wants to reverse
engineer programs that have been created using Borland C++ until about 2005
(the release of C++ Builder 2006).

Unfortunately, the source code of the exception handling was first released
with Borland C++ Builder, meaning that you will have to reverse-engineer the
XX.OBJ file for older versions yourself.

Sigh.

All of the content is (C) Borland / Inprise / Embarcadero (probably),
however it is deemed abandonware by WinWorldPC and the Internet Archive...
in any case, don't use these for commercial purposes I guess?
