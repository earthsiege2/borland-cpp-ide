1. TDSTRIP: The symbol table stripping utility
==============================================
TDSTRIP.EXE (and TDSTRP32, the 32-bit version of TDSTRIP) lets you
remove the symbol table from an executable program. This is a faster
way of removing the symbol table than recompiling and relinking your
program without symbolic debug information. TDSTRIP can also remove
debugging information from an .OBJ file:

   TDSTRIP PROGRAM.OBJ

You can also use TDSTRIP to remove the symbol table and put it in
a separate file. This is useful when you want to convert the .EXE
format program to a .COM file and still retain the debugging symbol
table. TDSTRIP puts the symbol table in a file with the extension
.TDS. Turbo Debugger looks for this file when it loads a program to
debug that doesn't have a symbol table.


TDSTRIP command-line options
----------------------------
The general form of the DOS command line used to start TDSTRIP is:

   TDSTRIP [-s] [-c] <exename> [<outputname>]

If you don't specify the -s option, the symbol table is removed from
the .EXE file <exename>. If you specify an <outputname>, the original
.EXE file is left unchanged and a version with no symbol table is created
as <outputname>.

If you do specify the -s option, the symbol table will be put in a
file with the same name as <exename> but with the extension .TDS. If you
specify an output file, the symbol table will be put in <outputname>.

If you specify the -c option, the input .EXE file is converted into a
.COM file. If you use -c in conjunction with -s, you can convert an
.EXE file with symbols into a .COM file with a separate .TDS symbol
file. This lets you debug .COM files with Turbo Debugger while
retaining full debugging information.

You can only convert certain .EXE files into .COM files. The same
restrictions apply to the -c option of TDSTRIP as to the /t option of
TLINK: Your program must start at location 100 hex, and it can't
contain any segment fixups.

The default extension for <exename> is .EXE. If you add an extension,
it overrides the default.

There are two default extensions for <outputname>,

o .TDS when you use the -s command-line switch
o .EXE when you don't use the -s command-line switch

If you add an extension, it overrides the defaults.

Here are some sample TDSTRIP command lines. The following command
removes the symbol table from MYPROG.EXE:

   TDSTRIP MYPROG

The following command removes the symbol table from MYPROG.OLD
and places it in MYPROG.TDS:

   TDSTRIP -s MYPROG.OLD

The following command leaves MYPROG.EXE unchanged but creates another
copy of it named MYPROG.NEW without a symbol table:

   TDSTRIP MYPROG MYPROG.NEW

The following command removes the symbol table from MYPROG.EXE and
places it in MYSYMS.TDS:

   TDSTRIP -s MYPROG MYSYMS


TDSTRIP error messages
----------------------
Following is a list of TDSTRIP error messages:

Can't create file: ___
  TDSTRIP couldn't create the output symbol or .EXE file. Either there
  is no more room on your disk, or you specified an invalid output file
  name.
  
Can't open file: ___
  TDSTRIP could not locate the .EXE file from which you want to remove the
  symbol table.

Error reading from input exe file
  An error occurred during reading from the input executable program
  file. Your disk may be unreadable. Try the operation again.

Error writing to output file: ___; disk may be full
  TDSTRIP couldn't write to the output symbol or executable file. This
  usually happens when there is no more room on your disk. You will have
  to delete some files to make room for the file created by TDSTRIP.

Input file is not an .exe file
  You've specified an input file name that isn't a valid executable
  program. You can strip symbols only from .EXE programs because these
  are the only ones that TLINK can put a symbol table in. Programs in
  .COM file format don't have symbol tables and can't be processed by
  TDSTRIP.

Invalid command-line option: ___
  You've given an invalid command-line option when starting TDSTRIP
  from the DOS command line.

Invalid exe file format
  The input file appears to be an .EXE format program file, but
  something is wrong with it. You should relink the program with TLINK.

Not enough memory
  Your system doesn't have enough free memory for TDSTRIP to load and
  process the .EXE file. This only happens in extreme circumstances
  (TDSTRIP has very modest memory requirements). Try rebooting your 
  system and running TDSTRIP again. You might have previously run a
  program that allocated some memory that won't be freed until you reboot.

Program does not have a symbol table
  You've specified an input file that's a valid .EXE file, but it
  doesn't have a symbol table.

Program does not have a valid symbol table
  The symbol table at the end of the .EXE file isn't a valid TLINK
  symbol table. This can happen if you try to use TDSTRIP on a program
  created by a linker other than TLINK. Relink the program with TLINK.

Too many arguments
  You can supply a maximum of two arguments to TDSTRIP, the first being
  the name of the executable program, and the second being the name of
  the output file for symbols or the executable program.

You must supply an exe file name
  You've started TDSTRIP without giving it the name of an .EXE program
  file whose symbol table you want to strip.


2. TDUMP: The file dumping utility
==================================
The TDUMP utility program produces a file dump that shows the 
structure of a file.

TDUMP breaks apart a file structurally and uses the file's extension to
determine the output display format. TDUMP recognizes many file formats, 
including .EXE, .OBJ, and .LIB files. If TDUMP doesn't recognize an 
extension, it produces a hexadecimal dump of the file.  You can control 
the output format by using command-line options when you start the 
program. (These options are described later).

TDUMP's ability to peek at a file's inner structure displays not only
a file's contents, but also how a file is constructed. Moreover,
because TDUMP verifies that a file's structure matches its extension,
you can also use TDUMP to test file integrity.


TDUMP syntax
------------
The DOS command-line syntax for TDUMP is:

   TDUMP [<options>] <Inputfile> [<Listfile>] [<options>]

<Inputfile> is the file whose structure you want to display (or "dump").
<Listfile> is an optional output file name (you can also use the standard
DOS redirection command ">"). <options> stands for any of the TDUMP
options discussed in the next section.


TDUMP command-line options
--------------------------
You can use several optional switches with TDUMP, all of which start with
a hyphen or a forward slash. The following two examples are equivalent:

   TDUMP -el -v demo.exe

   TDUMP /el /v demo.exe


  The -a and -a7 options
  ----------------------
  TDUMP automatically adjusts its output display according to the file type.
  You can force a file to be displayed as ASCII by including the -a or -a7 
  option.

  -a  produces an ASCII file display, which shows the offset and the contents
      in displayable ASCII characters. A character that is not displayable 
      (like a control character) appears as a period.

  -a7 converts high-ASCII characters to their low-ASCII equivalents. This 
      is useful if the file you are dumping sets high-ASCII characters as
      flags (WordStar files do this).


  The -b# option
  --------------
  The -b# option allows you to display information beginning at a specified
  offset.  For example, if you wanted a dump of MYFILE starting from offset
  100, you would use:

     TDUMP -b100 MYFILE


  The -e, -el, -er and -ex options
  --------------------------------
  All four options force TDUMP to display the file as an executable
  (.EXE) file.

  An .EXE file display consists of information contained within a file
  that is used by the operating system when loading a file.  If symbolic
  debugging information is present (Turbo Debugger or Microsoft CodeView),
  TDUMP displays it.

  TDUMP displays information for DOS executable files, NEW style executable
  files ( Microsoft Windows and OS/2 .EXEs and DLLs ), and Linear Executable
  files.

  -el suppresses line numbers in the display.

  -er prevents the relocation table from displaying.

  -ex prevents the display of New style executable information.
      This means TDUMP will only display information for the DOS
      "stub" program.


  The -h option
  -------------
  The -h option displays the dump file in hexadecimal (hex) format.  Hex
  format consists of a column of offset numbers, 16 columns of hex numbers,
  and their ASCII equivalents (a period appears where no displayable ASCII
  character occurs).

  If TDUMP doesn't recognize the input file's extension, it displays the
  file in hex format (unless an option is used to indicate another format).


  The -l option
  -------------
  The -l option displays the output file in library (.LIB) file format.
  A library file is a collection of object files (see the -o option for
  more on object files). The library file dump displays library-specific
  information, object files, and records in the object file.


  The -m option
  -------------
  The -m option leaves C++ names occurring in object files, executable
  files, and Turbo Debugger symbolic information files in "mangled" format.
  This option is helpful in determining how the C++ compiler "mangles"
  a given function name and its arguments.


  The -o, -oc, -ox, and -oi options
  ---------------------------------
  -o  displays the file as an object (.OBJ) file. An object file
      display contains descriptions of the command records that pass
      commands and data to the linker, telling it how to create an .EXE
      file.

      The display format shows each record and its associated data on a
      record-by-record basis.

  -oc causes TDUMP to perform a cyclic redundancy test (CRC) on each 
      encountered record. The display differs from the -o display only
      if an erroneous CRC check is encountered (the TDUMP CRC value differs
      from the record's CRC byte).

  -ox<id> excludes designated record types from the object module dump.
          Replace <id> with the record name not to be displayed. For 
          instance,

            TDUMP -oxPUBDEF MYMODULE.OBJ

          produces an object module display for MYMODULE.OBJ that excludes the
          PUBDEF records.

  -oi<id> includes only specified record types in the object module dump.
          Replace <id> with the name of the record to be displayed.
          For instance,

            TDUMP -oiPUBDEF MYMODULE.OBJ

          produces an object module display for MYMODULE.OBJ that displays 
          only the PUBDEF records.

  The -ox and -oi options are helpful in finding errors that occur during
  linking.   By examining the spelling and case of the EXTDEF symbol and 
  the PUBDEF symbol, you can resolve many linking problems. For instance, 
  if you receive an "unresolved external" message from the linker, use 
  "TDUMP -oiEXTDEF" to display the external definitions occurring in the 
  module causing the error.  Then, use "TDUMP -oiPUBDEF" on the module 
  containing the public symbol the linker could not match.

  Another use for the -oi switch is to check the names and sizes
  of the segments generated in a particular module.  For instance,

    TDUMP -oiSEGDEF MYMODULE.OBJ

  displays the names, attributes, and sizes of all of the segments
  in MYMODULE.


  The -v option
  -------------
  The -v option is used for verbose display.  If used with an .OBJ or .LIB
  file, TDUMP produces a hexadecimal dump of the record's contents without
  any comments about the records.


If you use TDUMP on a Turbo Debugger symbol table, it displays the 
information tables in the order in which it encounters them.  TDUMP 
doesn't combine information from several tables to give a more meaningful
display on a per-module basis.


3. TDMEM: The memory display utility
====================================
TDMEM displays the current availability of your computer's memory.
This includes Expanded or Extended memory, if it exists, and conventional 
memory.  This is useful when debugging TSR and device driver programs.  
You can use the File|Table relocate option in Turbo Debugger to specify 
a base segment address for the current symbol table that is shown when 
running TDMEM.


4. TDWINI: The video DLL setup utility
======================================
TDWINI helps you select and configure the video DLL that you use with TDW.
For complete instructions on this utility, see the online help (F1)
provided with the utility.


5. TDRF: Utility for remote file commands and file transfer
===========================================================
The remote file transfer utility (TDRF) works in conjunction with TDREMOTE
or WREMOTE running on another system.  (For more information on TDREMOTE and
WREMOTE, see the "Remote Debugging" appendix in the "Turbo Debugger User's 
Guide"). With TDRF you can perform most DOS file maintenance operations on 
the remote system. You can

  o copy files to the remote system
  o copy files from the remote system
  o make directories
  o remove directories
  o display directories
  o change directories
  o rename files
  o delete files

Once you have started TDREMOTE or WREMOTE on the remote system, you can
use TDRF at any time. You can start it directly from the DOS prompt, or
you can access DOS from inside Turbo Debugger by using the File|DOS
Shell command, then start TDRF (even while debugging a program on the
remote system). This second method is useful if you've forgotten to put
some files on the remote system that are required by the program you're
debugging.

When describing TDRF in the following sections, we refer to the system
you're typing at as the "local system" and any files there as "local
files," and the other system connected by a serial cable or network as 
the "remote system" and any files there as "remote files."


Starting TDRF from the DOS command line
---------------------------------------
The general form of the command line for TDRF is

   TDRF [<options>] <command> [<arguments>]

The <options> control whether the link is network or serial, and if it's
serial, the speed of the remote link and which port it runs on. The
options are described in more detail in the next section.

<command> indicates the operation you want to perform. You can type the 
command either as a DOS command--like COPY, DEL, MD, and so on--or as 
a single-letter abbreviation.

<arguments> are any arguments to the command.

For example, to get a directory display of all files starting with ABC
in the current directory on the remote system, you could type:

   TDRF DIR ABC*

All the commands are described fully after the next section.


TDRF command-line options
-------------------------
You must start an option with either a hyphen (-) or a slash (/).
The following list shows the command-line options for TDRF:

-rn<L>;<R>  Sets the link to network, the local name to <L>, and the remote
            name to <R>.

  If you link over the network, the name of the local machine defaults to
  "LOCAL" and the remote machine to "REMOTE". You can set your own name for
  the machines by entering a name up to 16 characters long for either the
  local machine, the remote machine, or both.
 
  You must be running TDREMOTE or WREMOTE with the -rn option on the remote
  machine with the local machine name set to the same name as you've indicated
  in the TDRF command.

-rsN        Sets the type of remote link to serial and the speed of the link.

  The -rs option sets the speed at which the remote serial link operates. 
  You must make sure you use the same speed with TDRF that you specified
  when you started TDREMOTE or WREMOTE on the remote system. N can be 1, 2,
  3, or 4, where 1 signifies a speed of 9600 baud, 2 signifies 19,200 baud, 
  3 signifies 38,400 baud, and 4 signifies 115,000 baud.

  In other words, the higher the number, the faster the data transfer
  rate across the serial link. Normally, TDRF defaults to -rs4 (the highest
  speed).

-rpN        Sets the remote serial link port.

  The -rp option specifies which port to use for the remote serial link.
  N can be either 1 or 2, where 1 stands for COM1 and 2 stands for COM2.

-w          Writes options to the TDRF executable program file.

  You can make the TDRF command-line options permanent by writing them
  back into the TDRF executable program image on disk. Do this by
  specifying the -w command-line option along with the other options you
  wish to make permanent. You will then be prompted for the name of the
  executable program.

  If you're running on DOS 3.0 or later, the prompt will indicate the
  path and file name that you executed TDRF from. You can accept this
  name by pressing Enter, or you can enter a new executable file name.
  The new name must already exist and must be a copy of the TDRF program 
  that you've already made.

  If you're running on DOS 2.x, you'll have to supply the full path
  and file name of the executable program.

  If you enter the name of an executable file that doesn't exist (a new
  filename), TDRF will create a new executable file.


TDRF commands
-------------
Following are the command names you can use with the TDRF utility. You
can use the wildcards * and ? with the COPY, COPYFROM, DEL, and DIR
commands.


COPY

  Copies files from the local system to the remote system. You can also
  type COPYTO instead of COPY. The single letter abbreviation for this
  command is T.

  If you supply a single file name after the COPY command, that file
  name will be copied to the current directory on the remote system. If
  you supply a second file name after the name of the file on the local
  system, the local file will be copied to that destination on the
  remote system. You can specify either a new file name, a directory
  name, or a drive name on the remote system. For example,

     TDRF COPY TEST1 \MYDIR
    
  copies file TEST1 from the local system to file MYDIR\TEST1 on the
  remote system.


COPYFROM

  Copies files from the remote system to the local system. The single
  letter abbreviation for this command is F.
  
  If you supply a single file name after the COPYFROM command, that file
  name will be copied from the current directory on the remote system to
  the current directory on the local system. If you supply a second file
  name after the name of the file on the remote system, the remote file
  will be copied to that destination on the local system. You can
  specify either a new file name, a directory name, or a drive name on
  the local system. For example,

     TDRF COPYFROM MYFILE ..

  copies file MYFILE from the remote system to the parent directory of
  the current directory on the local system.

     TDRF F TC*.* A:\TCDEMO
  
  copies all files beginning with TC on the current directory of the
  remote system to the TCDEMO directory on the local system's drive A.
  

DEL

  Erases a single file from the remote system. The single letter
  abbreviation for this command is E.

  If you just give a file name with no directory or drive, the file is
  deleted from the current directory on the remote system. For example,
  
     TDRF DEL XYZ
  
  removes file XYZ from the current directory of the remote system.
  

DIR

  Displays a listing of the files in a directory on the remote system.
  The single letter abbreviation for this command is D.
  
  This command behaves similarly to the equivalent DOS command. If
  you don't specify a wildcard mask, it shows all the files in the
  directory; if you do specify a mask, only those files will be listed.
  You can interrupt the directory display at any time by pressing
  Ctrl-Break.
  
  The directory listing is displayed in a format similar to that
  used by the DOS DIR command. For example,
  
     TDRF DIR \SYS\*.SYS
  
  results in a display like the following:
  
  Directory of C:\SYS

  ANSI         SYS     4833  8-23-91  6:00a
  VDISK        SYS     5190  8-23-91  6:00a
  
  
REN

  Renames a single file on the remote system. The single letter
  abbreviation for this command is R.
  
  You must supply two file names with this command: the original file
  name and the new file name. The new name can specify a different
  directory as part of the name, but not a different drive. For example,
  
     TDRF REN TEST1 \TEST2
  
  renames file TEST1 in the current directory in the remote to TEST2 in
  the root directory. This effectively "moves" the file from one
  directory to another. You can also use this command to simply rename a
  file within a directory, without moving it to another directory.
  
  
MD

  Makes a new directory on the remote system. The single letter
  abbreviation for this command is M.
  
  You must supply the name of the directory to be created. If you don't
  supply a directory path as part of the new directory name, the new
  directory will be created in the current directory on the remote
  system. For example,
  
     TDRF MD TEST
  
  creates a directory named TEST in the current directory on the remote
  system.
  

RD

  Removes an existing directory on the remote system. The single letter
  abbreviation for this command is K.
  
  You must supply the name of the directory to be removed. If you don't
  supply a directory path as part of the new directory name, the
  directory will be removed from the current directory on the remote
  system. For example,
  
     TDRF RD MYDIR
  
  removes a directory named MYDIR from the current directory on the
  remote system.
  

CD

  Changes to a new directory on the remote system. The single letter
  abbreviation for this command is C.
  
  You must supply the name of the directory to change to. You can also
  supply a new drive to switch to, or even supply a new drive and
  directory all at once. For example,
  
     TDRF CD A:ABC
  
  makes drive A the current drive on the remote system, and switches to
  directory ABC as well.
  
  
TDRF messages
-------------
Following is a list of the messages you might encounter when working with
TDRF:

"Can't create file on local system: ___"
  You were copying a file from the remote system using the COPYFROM 
  command, but the file could not be created on the local system. 
  Either the disk is full on the local system, or the file name on the
  remote system is the same as a directory name on the local system.

"Can't modify exe file"
  The file name you specified to modify is not a valid copy of the TDRF
  utility. You can only modify a copy of the TDRF utility with the -w
  option.

"Can't open exe file to modify"
  The file name you specified to be modified can't be opened. You've
  probably entered an invalid or nonexistent file name.

"Error opening file: ___"
  The file you wanted to transfer to the remote system could not be
  opened. You probably specified a nonexistent or invalid file name.

"Error writing file: ___"
  An error occurred while writing to a file on the local system, 
  probably because the local disk is full. Try deleting enough 
  files to make room for the file you want to copy from the 
  remote system.

"Error writing file ___ on remote system"
  An error occurred while writing a file to the disk on the remote
  system, probably because the remote disk is full. Try deleting
  enough files to make room for the file you want to transfer.

"File name is a directory on remote"
  You've tried to copy a file from the local to the remote system, but
  the local file name exists as a directory on the remote system. You'll
  have to rename the file by giving a second argument to the COPY
  command.

"Interrupted"
  You've pressed Ctrl-Break while waiting for communications to be
  established with the remote system.

"Invalid command: ___"
  You've entered a command that TDRF doesn't recognize. For each
  command, you can use the DOS-style command word or the single-letter
  abbreviation.

"Invalid command line option: ___"
  You've given an invalid command-line option when starting TDRF from
  the DOS command line.

"Invalid destination disk drive"
  You've specified a nonexistent disk drive letter in your command.
  Remember that the remote system might have a different number of disk
  drives than the local system.

"No matching files on remote"
  You've done a DIR command, but either there are no files in the
  directory on the remote system, or no files match the wildcard
  specification that you gave as an argument to the DIR command.

"No remote command specified"
  You haven't specified any command on the DOS command line; TDRF has
  nothing to do.

"Too few arguments"
  You haven't supplied enough arguments for the command you
  requested. Some commands require an argument, like DEL, MD, 
  CD, RD, and so on.

"Too many arguments"
  You've specified too many arguments for the command you requested.
  No command requires more than two arguments, and some require only one.

"Wrong version of remote driver"
  You're using incompatible versions of TDRF and TDREMOTE. Make sure
  you're using the latest version of each utility.
