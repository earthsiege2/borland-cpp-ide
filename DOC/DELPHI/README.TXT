                     Delphi 2.0 Trial Edition Readme
                     ===============================


Welcome to the Delphi 2.0 Trial Edition for Borland C++ developers.
Delphi offers developers the unique combination of RADical productivity 
with visual tools and reusable components, compiled performance, and 
seamless database scalability. 

The Delphi 2.0 Trial Edition for Borland C++ developers allows you to quickly
and easily create 32-bit Delphi applications.   Delphi is the perfect 
complementary productivity tool for C++ developers, offering quick, visual 
prototyping and UI building with the performance you expect from a compiler.  
All with minimal coding.  If you have a high performance back end C++ 
application, Delphi is the productive choice for a high performance 
front end.  You can even host Delphi forms in MFC or OWL.

Delphi applications run at least 10 times faster than interpreted code, 
thanks to the 32-bit native-code compiler, and are much smaller since they 
don't require runtime DLLs.  And creating sophisticated Windows user inter-
faces is a snap with the more than 90 reusable components included right in 
the box.  You can even create your own components and add them to the 
Component Palette for reuse later.

This is your opportunity to try Delphi for yourself. The Delphi 2.0 Trial 
Edition is a 30-day time-locked version of the award-winning Delphi 2.0 for
32-bit development.  We have included additional information on how to use
