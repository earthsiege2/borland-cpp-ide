                           ============
This guide presents style considerations you can follow when
designing Borland Windows Custom Control (BWCC) dialog boxes for
your Windows-based software.


PANELS
======
Each dialog box has two panels: a Main panel and an Action panel.
The Main panel should contain all the required controls. The 
Action panel should contain the push buttons.

Your finished dialog box should be relatively square. If the Main
panel is wider than it is tall, put the Action panel along the
bottom of your dialog box. If the Main panel is taller than it is
wide, put the Action panel on the right side.

Main panel
----------
You can arrange the group boxes on the Main panel in either a
single column or row, or in an array. Here are some guidelines for
arranging group boxes on the Main panel. You should treat group
titles as part of the group boxes.

- Space group boxes 8 dialog units apart, both vertically and
  horizontally.

- Leave a margin of 8 dialog units from all edges of the dialog
  to the nearest group box.

- In a column of group boxes, make all group boxes the same
  width. The width should accommodate the widest item or title.
  Widen the other group boxes to match.

- In a row of group boxes, vary the group box heights.
  Align the tops of the group boxes and let the bottoms of the
  group boxes vary.

- If some of the group boxes in a row have titles and some don't,
  align the top of the recessed group boxes with each other, not
  with the title rectangles. For these "mixed" groups of boxes,
  the margin above group boxes without titles should include the
  space for a title.

- If some of the group boxes you want to align in a row are
  taller than others, compute the bottom margin using the tallest
  group box.

Action panel
------------
An Action panel can appear at the bottom or the right side of a
dialog box. Here are the guidelines for Action panels:

- Make the Action panel tall or wide enough to contain the push buttons
  while leaving a margin of 8 dialog units above and below or to the 
  sides of the push buttons.

- Distribute the push buttons evenly along the Action panel,
  leaving a minimum of 8 dialog units between the buttons
  and between the buttons and the edges of the dialog box.
  Try to use the same number of dialog units between each button
  and between the buttons and the edges of the dialog box. You can 
  put more space between the buttons than between the buttons
  and the edges of the dialog box, if necessary, but the
  two margin spaces should be equal and the spaces between the
  buttons should be equal.


FONTS
=====
Borland dialog boxes use 8-point Helvetica Bold. The BWCC dialog
controls look best when you use this font. An 8-point font is
small; using it prevents your dialog boxes from growing too big. 
Of course, you can use other fonts for other custom controls.


GROUP BOXES
===========
Collect all options that appear in the Main panel into BWCC group
boxes. For example, place a group of related check boxes in a
group box. You should place each single control, such as a file
name text box or combo box, in a group box also. You won't have
to do this with a Borland list box because a list box draws its
own group box.

Group box titles
----------------
A group box title identifies what a group box contains. By
default, a group box title in a Borland dialog box has a gray
background. Here are guidelines for using group box titles:

- If a group box contains multiple controls, place the group box
  title above and touching the top edge of the group box.

- If a group box contains a single check box, place the group box
  title above and touching the top edge of the group box.

- If a group box contains a single text box or combo box control,
  you can either put the title to the left of the control and 4 units
  from the edge of the group box or you can put it above the control.

- If a group box contains two or more editable text fields or
  combo boxes or both, precede each with a short label.

- Align group box titles above the recessed group boxes.

- Make all group box titles 9 units high.

- Make the titles the same width as the group boxes, including
  the beveled sides.

Group box elements
------------------
These suggestions help you arrange elements within a group box:

- Distribute controls within a group box vertically every 13
  units from the bottom of one line of text to the bottom of the
  next.

- Left-justify the controls.

- The left and right margins between the edges of the group box
  and the widest control within it should be 4 dialog-units wide.

- Make the margin between the top of the group box and the first
  control in the group 4 dialog units.

- Make the margin between the bottom of the group box and the
  last control in the group 4 dialog units.

- If a group box contains two or more editable text fields or
  combo boxes or both, make them the same width. Space them so
  that the bottom of one is 13 units from the bottom of the
  next one. Right-justify these controls in the group box 4 units
  from the right edge. Left-justify the titles, leaving a 4 unit
  margin. Make the group box wide enough to leave 4 units between
  the longest title and its control.


PUSH BUTTONS
============
The following are style considerations for push buttons:

- Borland's push buttons use glyphs (small bitmapped images). For
  example, a question-mark glyph is used on the Help push button.
  Place the glyph inside the button on the left side.

- Use Helvetica (normal, not bold) for the button's text and
  right-justify it.

- Make each push button 39 pixels high for VGA resolution and 30
  pixels high for EGA resolution.

- Most push buttons are 63 pixels wide in both VGA and EGA
  resolution. Although you can make a button wider to prevent the
  text and image from overlapping or looking too crowded, you
  should try to restrict the width to 63 pixels if possible.

The Action panel push buttons usually indicate the end of a
user's work with a dialog box, but can also serve as a major
departure from the function of the dialog box, such as bringing up
Help with the Help button. The guidelines for these buttons are:

- Put the buttons on the Main panel rather than the Action panel.

- Don't put these push buttons in a group box. Place them
  directly on the surface of the Main panel.

- Make all push buttons in a group the same width. They should be
  just wide enough to accommodate the widest text string.

- Make the buttons 14 dialog units in height.

- Try to restrict text to 20 characters or less.

- Place the buttons in either a row or a column, depending on
  what looks best in your dialog box.

- Leave 8 dialog units to the left and right of a column of push
  buttons. The vertical space between the buttons and any other
  controls or borders above or below the buttons should be equal.

- Leave 8 dialog units above and below a row of push buttons. The
  horizontal space between the buttons and any other controls or
  borders to the left or right of them should be equal.


EXAMINING YOUR DIALOG BOX
=========================
When Windows calculates dialog units, it rounds the computation.
Rounding errors can affect the appearance of your dialog box. Examine
your dialog box carefully and look for these problems:

- A crack between the title text and the top of a gray group box

- Obvious uneven spacing in a vertical group of radio buttons or
  check boxes

- An inconsistent border width in exposed panel areas

Usually, making an adjustment of 1 dialog unit will fix these
problems. Occasionally in a large group of repeating controls,
two or more rounding errors can occur. You can't tell how text 
in controls will appear when you are designing your dialog box. 
Editable text, large static text fields, and combo boxes fall 
into this category. You may have to modify your original design
to be sure text appears correctly without being clipped at run time.
