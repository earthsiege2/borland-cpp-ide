                    ===========

This file explains switches used in the WORKSHOP.INI
file that control driver behavior (WORKSHOP.INI is
in your Windows directory).

A number of display drivers don't implement some
off-screen operations correctly. This file documents
specific workarounds for some of these driver problems.
Most of the workarounds were tested on a variety of drivers
and don't cause additional problems. However, some of these
workarounds have side effects on other drivers, or they
significantly affect the performance of the operation. These
workarounds are controlled by switches in WORKSHOP.INI.
Place all of the switches under the section [Resource Workshop].


RWS_OwnFloodFill=1
------------------
Some drivers don't perform flood fill correctly. Either the
operation fails, or vertical bars are placed on byte
boundaries in the image. If when using the paint can tool
you see either of these symptoms, use this switch to correct
it. Note that this switch is slower than the driver code.

RWS_Own16Color=1
----------------
If you are creating 16-color bitmaps with custom colors
(for example, a gray-scale image), you must turn off the
"Save with default device colors" option in the
Options|Editor options dialog box. If, after doing that, the
color table returns to the default colors after saving, use
this switch to correct the problem.

RWS_Own256Color=1
-----------------
If you're creating 256-color images with custom colors and
the colors return to the default, use this switch to correct
the problem.

RWS_ColorCopy=1
---------------
Some drivers don't perform GetDIBits properly when the
source device dependent bitmap is monochrome and either
less than 8 pixels wide or an odd number of pixels wide.
You can determine if this problem exists by creating a
new 6X6X2-Color image. If the initial image is black,
your driver has this problem. This switch copies the
monochrome image to a color image before calling GetDIBits.

NoDriverHacks=1
---------------
When using 256-color drivers, Resource Workshop displays
a grid on all zoomed images. Use this switch to turn off the
grid. If Workshop crashes when an image is zoomed, turn the
switch off and report the problem to your driver manufacturer.

bAutoH=0
--------
Use this switch to suppress the Add File To Project dialog
box when creating new .RC projects.
