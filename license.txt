2.  GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE.

2.1  Grant of License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Borland grants to you, if you 
are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization ("Named User") a 
personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely to create, compile 
(including byte code compile), test and deploy, in source or object code form, your own application 
programs and other works ("Works").  Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may

2.2  Multiple Licensed Copies.  You may purchase from Borland or its authorized reseller additional 
licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product (each, a "Named User License").  Such rights 
will be effective only when granted in writing by Borland or its authorized reseller and are conditioned 
upon your payment of the applicable fees.  If you purchase additional Named User Licenses for the Product 
then you are granted for each Named User License the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited 
license to designate one individual in your organization as the Named User and permit such Named User to 
install and use the Product solely as permitted under Section 2.1.  In such case, the Product may be used 
exclusively by the specifically designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this 
License. You agree that you will not designate more Named Users than the number of Named User Licenses 
that Borland or its authorized reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be 
used by any individuals other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time.  You agree to 
maintain accurate records of the Named User designated by you to use the Product under each Named User 
License you hold.

3.  GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO COMPILED PROGRAMS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES.

3.1  Redistributables.  The Product may include certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically 
designated as "redistributables" by Borland in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that 
are necessary to use Works created using the Product ("Redistributables").  From time to time, Borland may 
designate other files as Redistributables.  You should refer to the documentation, including any "readme" or 
"deploy" files provided with the Product, for additional information regarding Redistributables. Subject to 
the terms and conditions of this License, you may freely redistribute source code or compiled code that is 
entirely your own and does not contain any Redistributables. 

3.2  Licensing of Redistributables.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License including the 
restrictions of Section 3.3, Borland grants you the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited 
license to: (a) make exact copies of the Redistributables and distribute those copies solely as components of 
your Works and solely as required for permitting end users of the Works ("End Users") to install and 
execute the Works; (b) install and execute Redistributables, without modification, on computers that you 
own or possess solely for your own internal use; and (c) sublicense to your End Users the personal, non-
exclusive, non-transferable right to install and execute Redistributables, without modification, solely as 
components of Works and solely for such End Users' own internal use, subject to End Users' compliance 
with the restrictions in Section 5 as to Redistributables.  The rights granted to you under this Section 3.2 
may not be exercised by others, including co-developers, regardless of how you might compile, link, or 
package your Works.  These rights apply only to Redistributables and to no other file, library, source code 
or other component or derivative work of the Product.  They may be exercised only with respect to Works 
created by you using a duly licensed, properly registered copy of the Product.

3.3  Certain Restrictions.  Regardless of any modifications that you make and regardless of how you might 
compile, link, or package your Works:  (a) you may not permit your End Users to modify or further 
distribute Redistributables or use Redistributables in any program that they create; (b) you may not use 
Borland's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market your Works, except to state 
descriptively that your Work was written using the Product; (c) all copies of the Works you create must bear 
a valid copyright notice, either your own or the Borland copyright notice that appears on the Product, and 
you may not remove or alter any Borland copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained 
in any portion of the Redistributables; and (d) you may only distribute Redistributables with Works that add 
primary and substantial functionality to the Redistributables and are not merely a set or subset of any of the 
Redistributables, and that are created in accordance with the terms of this License.

3.4  Relationship with End Users.  Except as set forth in Section 4, there are no third party beneficiaries to 
this License.  Consequently, Borland provides no warranty at all to any person, other than the limited 
warranty provided to you the original purchaser of the Product, as set forth herein, and you will be solely 
responsible to your End Users (or anyone else who uses or acquires Works) for support, service, upgrades, 
or technical or other assistance (including with respect to any Redistributables included therein), and such 
persons will have no right to contact Borland for any services or assistance.  You will indemnify, defend 
and hold Borland, its licensors, its suppliers and each of their respective employees, officers, directors and 
affiliates, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of or related to the use, 
procurement, reproduction or distribution of your Works by third parties.

3.5  Third Party Software.  The Product, including Redistributables, may include source code, 
redistributable files, and/or other files provided by a third party vendor ("Third Party Product").  Since use 
of Third Party Product might be subject to license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor, you 
should refer to the on-line documentation (if any) provided with Third Party Product for any license 
restrictions imposed by the third party vendor.  In any event, any license restrictions imposed by a third 
party vendor are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions of this License.

3.6  Other Rights.  Contact Borland for the applicable royalties due and other licensing terms for all other 
uses or distribution of the Redistributables.

4.  SPECIAL TERMS.
The following terms and conditions ("Special Terms") are specific to certain editions, versions and 
components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Sections 2 and 3.  If any provision of the 
Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the 
provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control.

ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR INTERBASE 
The portion of the Product identified as InterBase is not a Redistributable and is licensed for development

deploying or distributing any Work that uses InterBase.

part of the Product. These Accompanying Products are subject to separate license terms which are on the 
media containing the Accompanying Products and which may be viewed and accepted at the time the 
Accompanying Products are installed.  You have no rights under this License to use any software other than

and obtain separate License Key Certificates.

ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS RELATING TO THE TRANSLATION MANAGER
The portion of the Product identified as the "Translation Manager" may accompany copies of your Works 
that are provided to a third party for the sole purpose of localization of such Works (e.g. the translation of a 
Work, for example, from the English language to the German language). The third party may receive and 
may only use, subject to the terms and conditions of this License, five copies of the Translation Manager for 
each Licensed Copy. You agree that you shall be liable for any violation of this License by such third party.

4.3  ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO EVALUATION SOFTWARE

You may not use the Product for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any 
kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product by you is prohibited without the 
purchase of a commercial license.  If you do not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the 
Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently remove or delete the Product from all computer 
systems on which it was installed and destroy any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall 
a new copy of the Product. If you desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you 
should contact Borland or a Borland authorized reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product.

4.4  ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR

the Product and to create Works solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction

You agree that Borland's third-party licensors and suppliers are intended third party beneficiaries of all 
terms and conditions of this License intended to protect intellectual property rights in the Product (including 
the Third-Party Software) and limit certain uses thereof.

4.6  ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO UPGRADES

If you have purchased an upgrade version of the Product, it constitutes a single product with the copy of the 
Product that you upgraded.  This means that, although you may have two sets of Product media, you still 
have only one license.  Therefore, you may not transfer the original copy of the Product to any other party.

5.  LIMITATIONS.  You may not:  (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of the 
Product or merge the Product with other software other than as described in the Product's accompanying

or proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) of Borland or its suppliers on the

the Product as part of a service bureau or, except as expressly authorized under Sections 2, 3 or 4, otherwise 
for the use or benefit of third parties; (g) reproduce or use the Product except as expressly authorized under 
Sections 2, 3 or 4; or (h) disclose or publish performance benchmark results for the Product.  The rights 
granted under this License apply only to this Product.  You must procure a separate license to use other 
Borland software.  Furthermore, you may not permit your End Users to conduct the restricted activities 
limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to Redistributables, and such End 
User's sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations.  The 
limitations in this Section 5 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any 
component or Redistributable.

6.  LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.  Borland warrants to you, the original purchaser and 
to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be 
free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you 
initially acquire the Product.  Your exclusive remedy and Borland's sole liability for breach of this warranty 
is that Borland will replace any defective media returned to Borland within the ninety (90) day warranty 
period.  This warranty does not apply to damages resulting from misuse, abuse or neglect.  Any replacement 
media will be warranted as above for the remainder of the original warranty period or twenty (20) days from 
the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer.  EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED 
WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND.  BORLAND HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY 
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR 
QUIET ENJOYMENT.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-
FREE OR WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.  YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK 
FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT.  TO THE EXTENT THAT BORLAND 
MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE 
AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER 
SUCH LAW. 

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE 
ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU 
SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH 
VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

7.  SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES.  Borland is not required under this License to 
provide any installation, training or other services to you.  Such services, if available, must be purchased 
separately.  If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, Borland provides you with a new 
release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be 
deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License, unless the modification is expressly 
provided subject to a separate license agreement. Borland reserves the right at any time not to release or to 
discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, 
licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the 
Product.

8.  REGISTRATION.  You must register the Product with Borland as a condition to your rights to use the 
Product.  You will be prompted to register the Product at the time of your installation or first use of the 
Product, at which time you will be notified (or directed to online resources explaining) how registration 
information provided by you may be used and you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out of certain uses 
of such information.

9.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  You acknowledge that the Product in source code form remains a confidential trade 
secret of Borland.  You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person, and not use it for 
any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License.

10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL BORLAND BE LIABLE TO ANY 
PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE 
PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF BORLAND 
KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  BORLAND'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED 
TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR 
OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS 
LICENSE.  THIS SECTION 10 WILL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY 
HEREUNDER HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT 
APPLY TO YOU.

11.  THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.  Borland will defend and settle any suit brought against you by a third 
party (not your affiliate) based on a claim that the Product infringes upon any U.S. copyright and Borland 
will pay those costs and damages finally awarded against you in such suit that are specifically attributable to 
such claims or those amounts payable by you under a settlement of such suit. The foregoing obligations are 
conditioned on you:  (a) notifying Borland promptly in writing of such action; (b) giving Borland sole 
control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at Borland's 
request and expense, assisting in such defense. If the Product becomes, or in Borland's opinion is likely to 
become, the subject of an infringement claim that Borland is required to defend, then Borland may (at its 
option and expense) either:  (a) procure for you the right to continue using the Product; (b) replace or 
modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing; or (c) terminate this License and your rights 
hereunder to use the Product and refund a pro rata portion of any license fee you paid under this License, 
based on a three (3) year product life. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borland will have no obligation under 
this Section 11 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon:  (a) any use of the Product 
not in accordance with this License or the products accompanying documentation: (b) any use of the 
Product in combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not provided by Borland; (c) any 
use of any version of the Product other than the most current version made available to you; or (d) any 
modification of the Product by any person other than Borland or its authorized agents ("Excluded Claims"). 
You will indemnify Borland against all liability, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) 
resulting from or related to an Excluded Claim. This section 11 states Borland's entire liability and your 
sole and exclusive remedy for third-party claims relating to the Product.
