Description     randbrd reads reccnt number of records using the
                open FCB pointed to by fcbptr. The records are read into memory
                at the current disk transfer address. They are read from the
                disk record indicated in the random record field of the FCB.
                This is accomplished by calling DOS system call 0x27.

                randbwr performs essentially the same function as randbrd,
                except that data is written to disk instead of read from disk.
                This is accomplished using DOS system call DOS 0x28. If reccnt
                is 0, the file is truncated to the length indicated by the
                random record field.

                The actual number of records read or written can be determined
                by examining the random record field of the FCB. The random
                record field will be advanced by the number of records actually
                read or written.

Return value    The following values are returned, depending upon
                the result of the randbrd or randbwr operation:

                        0       All records are read or written.

                        1       End-of-file is reached and the last record
                                read is complete.

                        2       Reading records would have wrapped around
                                address 0xFFFF (as many records as possible
                                are read).

                        3       End-of-file is reached with the last record
                                incomplete.

                randbwr returns 1 if there is not enough disk space to write
                the records (no records are written).
