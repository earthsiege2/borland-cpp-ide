Name            _dos_read - reads from file

Usage           unsigned _dos_read(int handle, void far *buf, unsigned nbyte,
                                unsigned *nread);

Prototype in    dos.h

Description     _dos_read is a direct call to the MS-DOS read system call.
                The buffer pointer buf must be a far pointer.  The number
                of bytes requested is nbyte.

                If the read is successful, the number of bytes actually
                read is stored at *nread.  If *nread is 0, an attempt
                was made to read at the end of file.
                No text file translation is performed on the data read.

Return value    success : 0, and *nread is set to no. of bytes read
                else    : the DOS error code, and errno is set to
                          one of the following:

                        EACCESS  Permission denied
                        EBADF    Bad file number

Note            Compatible with Microsoft C.  Not the same as _read().
