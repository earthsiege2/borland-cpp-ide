Name            wait1 - wait 1 second

Usage           void wait1(void);

Description     wait1() uses _dos_gettime() in a spin loop to wait 1 second.

Return value    No value is returned.

Portability     Unique to MS-DOS. On multi-tasking operating systems
                this should be rewritten to do a wait.

Name            locking - sets file sharing locks

Usage           int locking(int handle, int mode, long length);

Prototype in    io.h

Description     locking provides an interface to the MS-DOS
                3.x file-sharing mechanism.  The region to be locked
                or unlocked starts at the current file position;
                the size of the region is given by length.

                The mode parameter specifies the action (values
                for mode are given in <sys\locking.h>):

                LK_LOCK         lock the region; if unsuccessful, try
                                once a second for 10 seconds before
                                giving up.
                LK_NBLCK        lock the region, if unsuccessful, give
                                up immediately.
                LK_NBRLCK       Same as LK_NBLCK.
                LK_RCLK         Same as LK_LOCK.
                LK_UNLCK        Unlock the region, which must have
                                been previously locked.

                Locks can be placed on arbitrary, non-overlapping regions of
                any file. A program attempting to read or write into a
                locked region will retry the operation three times. If all
                three retries fail, the call fails with an error.

                unlock removes lock; to avoid error, lock must be removed
                before a file is closed. A program must release all lock(s)
                before completing.

Return value    Locking return 0 on success.  On failure, -1 is returned,
                and errno is set to one of the following:

                EACCESS         File already locked or unlocked
                EBADF           Bad file number
                EDEADLOCK       File cannot be locked after 10 retries
                                (mode is LK_LOCK or LK_RLCK)
                EINVAL          Invalid mode


Portability     Unique to MS-DOS 3.x. Older versions of MS-DOS do
                not support these calls.

Note            Compatible with Microsoft C.  Not the same as lock().
