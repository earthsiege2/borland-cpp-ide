Name            _dos_write - writes data to file

Usage           unsigned _dos_write(int handle, void far *buf, unsigned nbyte,
                                unsigned *nwrite);

Prototype in    dos.h

Description     _dos_write is a direct call to the MS-DOS write system call.
                The buffer pointer buf must be a far pointer.  The number
                of bytes requested is nbyte.

                If the write is successful, the number of bytes actually
                written is stored at *nwrite, which may be less than
                the number of bytes requested.
                No text file translation is performed on the data.

Return value    success : 0, and *nwrite is set to no. of bytes written
                else    : the DOS error code, and errno is set to
                          one of the following:

                        EACCESS  Permission denied
                        EBADF    Bad file number

Note            Compatible with Microsoft C.  Not the same as _write().
