Name            _matherr - user-modifiable math error handler

Usage           #include <math.h>
                int _matherr(struct exception *e);

Prototype in    math.h

Description     When  exceptions are  detected in  the math  library then a
                call is made  to  _matherr()  with all the available
                information.

                That function does very little, except to map the exception
                "why"  into either  ERANGE or  EDOMAIN in  errno. Its  main
                purpose is  to act as  a focal point  for changes in  error
                handling.

                For example,  if you were  writing a spreadsheet  you might
                replace  this function with one which pops up an error
                window explaining something like:

                        "log (-2.0) caused domain error, in cell J7"

                and then longjmp() to a  reset state in the spreadsheet and
                await the next command from the user.

                The default version  of Turbo C's _matherr routine masks
                underflow and precision errors; others errors are considered
                fatal.  It serves as a hook that you can replace when
                writing your own math error handling routine.

                The rationale for masking underflow and precision errors
                is that these are not errors according to the ANSI C spec.
                Consequently, you will get
                        exp(-1000) = 0
                        sin(1e100) = NAN
                without any error or warning, even though there is a total
                loss of precision in both cases.  You can trap these errors
                by modifying _matherr.

                The possible errors are
                        DOMAIN, SING, OVERFLOW, UNDERFLOW, TLOSS, PLOSS
                and listed in <math.h>.  As explained above, UNDERFLOW and
                TLOSS are masked by the default _matherr.  PLOSS is not
                supported by TC and is not generated by any library functions.
                The remaining errors, DOMAIN, SING, and OVERFLOW, are fatal
                with the default _matherr.

                You  can  modify  _matherr  to  be  a  custom error handling
                routine (such as one that catches and resolves certain type
                of  errors); the  modified _matherr  should return  0 if  it
                failed to resolve  the error, or non-zero if  the error was
                resolved. When _matherr returns non-zero, no  error message
                is printed, and errno is not changed.

                The  important thing  is  that  we  don't  know what error
                handling you want, but you are assured that all errors will
                arrive at  _matherr() with all  the information you  need to
                design a custom format.

                We  do not  ship as  standard the  function named _matherr()
                which may be  familiar to UNIX users, since  the ANSI x3j11
                draft specifies  an incompatible style. This  version is as
                close as we could get  without breaking the ANSI rules. You
                can, however, convert this version to the UNIX style if you
                prefer. The necessary code is included but switched off.

Return value    The default return  value for _matherr is simply  0.
                _matherr can also modify  e->retval, which propagates through
                _matherr back to the original caller.

                When _matherr returns 0, (indicating that it was not able to
                resolve the error) __matherr sets  errno and prints an error
                message.

                When _matherr returns non-zero, (indicating that it was able
                to resolve the error) errno is not set and no messages are
                printed.
