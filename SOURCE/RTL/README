          WELCOME TO BORLAND C++BUILDER RUNTIME LIBRARY SOURCE 11.0
          ---------------------------------------------------------

  This README contains information on support for the Borland C++Builder 6.0
  Runtime Library source code.

  BUILDING THE RTL
  ----------------

  IMPORTANT:  In order to build the libraries, the RTL tools directory
  must be present on your path.  These tools are located in the tools
  subdirectory of the directory where the source was copied.  For
  example, if you have copied the RTL source tree into

       C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder\SOURCE\RTL
  then
       C:\PROGRA~1\Borland\CBuilder\SOURCE\RTL\TOOLS

  must be added to your path.

  If the RTL was not copied into the C++Builder installation area in the
  SOURCE subdirectory, you will need to set the RTLROOT environment variable
  to point to the location of the RTL source files. For example, if the
  compiler was installed in

     C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder

  and the RTL tree was copied to

     D:\RTLSOURCE

  then you must set the RTLROOT environment variable as follows:

     SET RTLROOT=D:\RTLSOURCE

  To build the RTL, change to the directory into which the source was copied
  and run the BUILD.BAT file.  For example:

    c:\> cd C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder\SOURCE\RTL

    c:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder\source\rtl\> BUILD

  Once the RTL has been built, the new .OBJ, .LIB, .DLL, & .TDS files will
  be located in the SOURCE\RTL\LIB directory.  You should copy all the *.OBJ
  & *.LIB files to your main CBuilder\Lib directory and copy the *.DLL &
  *.TDS files to your main CBuilder\Bin directory.


  DEBUGGING INFORMATION
  ---------------------

  To build the RTL with debug info enabled, set the environment variable
  DEBUG=1, then proceed with the build as normal.

  Keep in mind that the build process really preforms a "make" re-compiling
  only the OBJs that are out of date.  If you've built copies of the RTL
  previously, then in order to get a complete re-build of the RTL you should
  delete all files and subdirs in RTL\OBJ\WIN32 and RTL\LIB and then re-copy
  those dirs and subdirs from the CD-ROM.

  Alternatively, you can set the environment variable
  RTL_FORCE_FULL_REBUILD=1 then proceed with the build as normal.


  RUNTIME LIBRARY SUPPORT
  -----------------------

  The Borland C++Builder Runtime Library source code is provided for your
  use and modification.

  IMPORTANT: Borland will only provide technical support for the RTL as it
  was shipped.  This means that if you use the source code to re-build the
  RTL, even if you have not modified the source, then no technical support
  is availible from Borland.  Essentially, the RTL sources are provided "as
  is" and you are on your own.

  If you find what you think is a genuine problem in the source code,
  we want to hear about it. Technical Support is available from the
  following sources:

  1. Internet: http://www.borland.com

  2. Borland's TECHFAX service. Call (800) 822-4269 for a FAX
     catalog of technical document entries.

     C++Builder to programming or debugging, call our C++Builder
