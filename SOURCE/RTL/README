          WELCOME TO BORLAND C++ RUNTIME LIBRARY SOURCE 8.02
          --------------------------------------------------

  This README contains information on support for the Borland C++
  Runtime Library source code.

  BUILDING THE RTL
  ----------------

  IMPORTANT:  In order to build the libraries, the RTL tools directory must
  be present on your path.  These tools are located in the tools
  subdirectory of the directory where the source was installed.

  For example, if your Borland C++ root installation directory is C:\BC5,
  and the RTL source was copied into C:\BC5\SOURCE\RTL then
  C:\BC5\SOURCE\RTL\TOOLS must be added to your path.

  You must have TASM.EXE and TASM32.EXE installed from Borland Turbo
  Assembler before you can build the Run Time Library.

  To build the rtl, change to the directory into which the source was copied
  and run the BUILD.BAT file. If no parameters are passed to BUILD.BAT, a
  help screen is displayed listing the possible sections of the RTL that can
  be built.  To build that section, run BUILD.BAT with that parameter. For
  example :

    c:\> cd C:\BC5\SOURCE\RTL

    c:\bc5\source\rtl\> BUILD ALL

  will build everything.

  Note: if the RTL was not copied into the \SOURCE\RTL directory of the
  compiler installation (ie: C:\BC5\SOURCE\RTL), you will need to set the
  environment variable: RTLROOT= to point to the location accordingly. For
  example, if the compiler is in C:\BC5\, and the RTL SOURCE is in
  D:\MYSTUFF\Borland\SOURCE\RTL, then make sure to:

    SET RTLROOT=D:\MYSTUFF\Borland\SOURCE\RTL

  before you run BUILD.BAT.


  DEBUGGING INFORMATION
  ---------------------

  To build any sections of the RTL with debug info enabled, set the
  environment variable: DEBUG=1.  Then proceed with the build as normal.

  Keep in mind that the build process really preforms a "make" re-compiling
  only the OBJs that are out of date.  If you've built copies of the RTL
  previously, then in order to get a complete re-build of the RTL you should
  delete all files and subdirs in RTL\OBJ\ and RTL\LIB and then re-copy
  those dirs and subdirs from the CD-ROM.
