	  WELCOME TO BORLAND C++ RUNTIME LIBRARY SOURCE 6.5
	  -------------------------------------------------

  This README contains information on support for the Borland C++
  Runtime Library source code.  

  BUILDING THE RTL
  ________________

  IMPORTANT:  In order to build the libraries, the RTL tools
  directory must be present on your path.  These tools are located
  in the tools subdirectory of the directory where the source
  was installed.  For example:

  If your Borland C++ root installation directory is C:\BC45, the RTL
  source was installed into C:\BC45\SOURCE\RTL and C:\BC45\SOURCE\RTL\TOOLS
  must be added to your path.

  You must have TASM.EXE installed from Borland Turbo Assembler before you
  can build the Run Time Library.

  To build the rtl, move to the directory where the source was installed 
  and type build.bat. An help screen is displayed allowing you to choose
  which part of the RTL you want to build. For example :

      C:\BC45\SOURCE\RTL\BUILD ALL

  will build everything.

  NB : if the RTL was not installed in the C:\BC45\SOURCE\RTL directory 
  you will need to modify the file RULES.MAK to set the RTLROOT variable
  accordingly.
  Due to limitations in spawning a 16 bit application by a 32 bit 
  application under Windows NT, you cannot build the 16 bit libraries
  under Windows NT.
