{  General rules for being installed in the Control Panel:

      1) The DLL must export a function named CPlApplet which will handle
         the messages discussed below.
      2) If the applet needs to save information in CONTROL.INI minimize
         clutter by using the application name [MMCPL.appletname].
      2) If the applet is refrenced in CONTROL.INI under [MMCPL] use
         the following form:
              ...
              [MMCPL]
              uniqueName=c:\mydir\myapplet.dll
              ...


  The order applet DLL's are loaded by CONTROL.EXE is:

      1) MAIN.CPL is loaded from the windows system directory.

      2) Installable drivers that are loaded and export the
         CplApplet() routine.

      3) DLL's specified in the [MMCPL] section of CONTROL.INI.

      4) DLL's named *.CPL from windows system directory.


 CONTROL.EXE will answer this message and launch an applet

 WM_CPL_LAUNCH

      wParam      - window handle of calling app
      lParam      - LPTSTR of name of applet to launch

 WM_CPL_LAUNCHED

      wParam      - TRUE/FALSE if applet was launched
      lParam      - NULL

 CONTROL.EXE will post this message to the caller when the applet returns
 (ie., when wParam is a valid window handle)

  {$EXTERNALSYM CPL_DYNAMIC_RES}
  CPL_DYNAMIC_RES = 0;
  { This constant may be used in place of real resource IDs for the idIcon,
    idName or idInfo members of the CPLINFO structure.  Normally, the system
    uses these values to extract copies of the resources and store them in a
    cache.  Once the resource information is in the cache, the system does not
    need to load a CPL unless the user actually tries to use it.

    CPL_DYNAMIC_RES tells the system not to cache the resource, but instead to
    load the CPL every time it needs to display information about an item.  This
    allows a CPL to dynamically decide what information will be displayed, but
    is SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than displaying information from a cache.
    Typically, CPL_DYNAMIC_RES is used when a control panel must inspect the
    runtime status of some device in order to provide text or icons to display.
