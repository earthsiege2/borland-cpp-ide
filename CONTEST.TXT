ObjectScripting Contest
-----------------------
Borland International is conducting a contest to find the
 best possible examples of the power and time savings
 developers will realize using ObjectScripting. We want you
 to create the most "productivity enhancing" scripts that
 will appeal to the largest number of developers. In return,
 Borland will award a free laptop computer (valued at
 approximately $4,000.00) as Grand Prize. The Grand Prize
 winner will also be offered a speaking engagement at the
 1996 Borland Developers Conference (BDC), in Anaheim, CA,
 to present his/her winning ObjectScripting entry.
 In addition, all entrants whose scripts are chosen as
 Honorable Mention will have their scripts or script
 derivations placed on a CD (or diskette) to be published
 by Borland and will receive a free copy of that CD/diskette.
 Detailed submission format instructions and tips to ensure
 that your entry has the best chance of winning are listed
 below in the section: Entry Submission Specifications.
 Read the ObjectScripting Contest Rules and Conditions below.
 All questions and/or disputes will refer strictly to these
 Rules and Conditions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry Submission Specifications
-------------------------------
All script entries must be the original work of the submitting
  individual.  Scripts should be designed to run under the
  standard Borland C++ or Development Suite 5.0 installation.

Refer to Appendix A of this text for an example of the
  information required on the paper entry form enclosed in
  your product package.

To ensure that your entry can be judged, you should:
----------------------------------------------------
  Test to ensure your entry will work in various environments.
    For example, be sure that your entry is not unneccesarily
    dependent on a certain operating system and/or hardware
    configuration.  Borland Int'l. will be testing scripts on
    a variety of systems under both Windows 95 and NT 3.51.

  Be sure that your script is error and bug free.
    Borland Int'l. will not judge scripts that fail to work
    properly.

  Follow the same coding style and comment usage that is set
    forth in the example scripts located in
    BC5\SCRIPT\EXAMPLES\EVALTIPS.SPP and FOREACH.SPP.

  Include any information on the setup and execution of your
    script and any test data if applicable, in its README.TXT.
    (See example README.TXT in Appendix B below).

(NOTE: Overly complex and/or unclear instructions will inhibit
 Borland International's ability to judge the script).
	
Entries should be in the following format:
------------------------------------------

  For individuals submitting a single entry:
--------------------------------------------
    The entry, (consisting of one or more associated scripts
      and associated files),is placed in a single directory
      on the 3.5" disk.(i.e. A:\Entry01)

    The README.TXT is placed on the root of that directory.
		
	
  For individuals submitting more than a single entry:
------------------------------------------------------
    Each entry is placed in its own individual directory.
      (i.e.  A:\Entry01  A:\Entry02 etc.)

    The README.TXT is on the root of the corresponding
      entry directory.

NOTE:  U.S. citizens or residents may submit their contest
  entries on the World Wide Web.  Check Borland Online at
  http://www.borland.com.

The README.TXT must include the following information:
------------------------------------------------------
  Contestant name, address, telephone number, E-mail address,
    and submission title.
	
  A 25 word description of the benefit/value your entry will
    provide to developers who use it.

  Any installation instructions. 

  Detailed instructions on how to use the script as well as
    any neccesary sample data.
	
  Any other information you feel is relevant to the judging
    of the entry.
(NOTE:  Keep in mind that overly complex and or unclear
        instructions will inhibit Borland International's ability
        to judge the entry.)

An example README.TXT is provided as Appendix B.

Submission Title:	Evaluating variables using "ToolTips"

This script automatically displays the value of a variable
  when the mouse is moved over it. Similar to how ToolTips
  displays the value within a small window near a toolbar.

Usage:

  Copy all files from A:\<Entry01> to a directory in the script 
    search path.
  Load the script \BC5\SCRIPT\EXAMPLES\EVALTIPS.SPP.
  Set a breakpoint in an .EXE and run to that location. 
    (i.e. set a breakpoint in the \BC5\EXAMPLES\OWL\APPS\BLAZER
    application.)
  Move the mouse over a variable.
  Hold it there for a few seconds - should see a small yellow 
    window containing the value of the variable at that point.

In closing, Borland International urges you to keep in mind
 that we will be looking for scripts that directly enhance
 C/C++ or Java developer productivity, and that will appeal
 to the widest range of developers.
